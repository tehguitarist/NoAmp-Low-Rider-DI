# NoAmp Low Rider DI — Project Memory  (from the pedal-plugin template)

> NoAmp Low Rider DI is a circuit-level emulation of the **Tech 21 SansAmp Bass Driver DI (BDDI)**
> built as an AU/VST3 plugin using JUCE 8+ and chowdsp_wdf WDF modelling. Unlike most pedals built
> from this template, this project models **three selectable circuit revisions of the same pedal**
> — V1 Early, V1 Late, and V2 — sharing reusable DSP/UI primitives where practical. DI/line-out/XLR
> circuitry and phantom-power handling are explicitly out of scope; only the instrument-level 1/4"
> output path is modelled (see `circuit.md`'s scope decision).
> Author/Company: Leigh Pierce

This project was scaffolded from a reusable template. The generic, hard-won engineering lives in
the rules + docs below — read them before writing DSP or UI.

## Quick reference

```
Build:  cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build
AU:     cmake --build build --target NoAmpLowRiderDI_AU     (auto-installs; bump VERSION to force Logic rescan)
Format: clang-format -i src/**/*.{cpp,h}
```

## Schematics

Schematic images + FR sim graphs live in `schematics/`; they are transcribed/verified into
`.claude/rules/circuit.md` (component values + roles), `.claude/rules/netlists.md` (**node-level
per-stage connectivity — what a WDF task actually builds from**), and `docs/reference-fr-targets.md`
(quantitative FR targets). **Never re-read the schematic PNGs** — four verification passes are done
(values 3×, node wiring 1×, with numeric cross-checks); the only flagged residual ambiguities are
tagged `[◐]` in `netlists.md` with a named FR self-validation gate each, so even those resolve
without images.

**Use the `schematic-checker` agent any time a circuit value or topology is in doubt; use
`dsp-validator` after any DSP stage change.** Both read `circuit.md`/`dsp.md` — keep those current.

## Rule / reference files — READ ON DEMAND, not auto-loaded

> These are **deliberately NOT `@`-included** (that would auto-load ~19k tokens — dominated by the
> 11k-token `circuit.md` — into *every* session, defeating the per-task reading discipline the build
> plan depends on). Each task in `docs/build-plan.md` lists the exact files + sections to read. Load
> only those. `circuit.md` especially is a per-revision reference: a V1-Early task reads the V1-Early
> tables, not the whole file.

| File | Read when |
|------|-----------|
| `.claude/rules/circuit.md` | any DSP/circuit task — **only the relevant revision's tables + cited notes** |
| `.claude/rules/netlists.md` | any WDF/stage-building task — **only that revision's stage section(s)**; node-level wiring + per-stage gates. Wins over circuit.md's Function cells on conflict |
| `.claude/rules/dsp.md` | any DSP task (WDF/ADAA/oversampling/omega) |
| `.claude/rules/architecture.md` | processor-level / threading / APVTS / integration tasks |
| `.claude/rules/build.md` | CMake / CI / test-harness tasks |
| `.claude/rules/ui.md` + `docs/ui-peripheral-spec.md` | UI tasks |
| `docs/ui-noamp-assets.md` | pedal-face layout/asset tasks — this pedal's bitmap-asset map, font, wordmark, per-revision layout |
| `docs/reference-fr-targets.md` | any linear-stage validation (the FR gates cite its §§) |
| `docs/calibration-and-gain-staging.md` | level/rail/makeup calibration tasks |
| `docs/validation-and-capture.md` | capture-based validation (Phase 10) |
| `docs/build-plan.md` | **start here** — the phased plan with per-task model + read-list + gates |

## Essential reading (template learnings — do not skip)

- **`docs/calibration-and-gain-staging.md`** — input-load (`kInputRef`) calibration, output-makeup
  calibration (level-match to captures — NOT a ~0.9 headroom pad; see §2), the DRIVE taper-floor
  bug, output-load (negligible), internal-vs-output clipping, op-amp rails, VU idle gate. This is
  where the non-obvious time-sinks are documented.
- **`docs/reference-fr-targets.md`** — **(project-specific)** quantitative frequency-response targets
  for every stage/control on all three revisions, transcribed from the author's SPICE sim graphs.
  The first-pass validation reference for every linear stage — available before any real capture.
- **`docs/validation-and-capture.md`** — how to measure how close the plugin is to the real pedal
  (1/6-oct+densified FR read across a 5-level sweep bank, continuous Farina swept-THD, sub-sample
  null, knob-tracking pass/fail) and how to
  CAPTURE the pedal so the measurement is trustworthy (bypass anchor, one-knob-at-a-time, sweep
  Volume, no truncation). The capture MATRIX, not the signal, is the usual limitation.
- **`analysis/`** — the reusable harness plus Phase-10 diagnostic scripts. ALWAYS write analysis
  commands as standalone scripts in `analysis/` (never as inline Python in a tool call — inline
  commands block the terminal on long-running harmonic/THD scans, and the output can't be
  recovered mid-execution). Use `analyze.py` + `noamp_captures.py` as the library layer.
  Existing analysis scripts (run from repo root with python3.11):
  - `ab_report.py` — full A/B across all captures (FR, THD, null depth, level)
  - `harmonic_report.py` — per-harmonic H2..H7 vs pedal (diagnostic)
  - `sat_calibrate.py` — 3D sweep of sat-gain/sat-knee/sat-offset values
  - `vzt_sweep.py` — zener knee softness scan
  - `rail_knee_sweep.py` — RailClip parabolic knee scan
  - `asymmetry_check.py` — zener asymmetry m-factor vs pedal H2
  - `check_asym_sources.py` — asymmetric rails vs sat-offset comparison
  - `cj_scan.py` — zener junction capacitance fit
  - `sat_sweep.py` / `sat_sweep2.py` — recovery saturation gain/knee scans
  - `verify_sat_fix.py` — verify calibrated saturation offset params
  - `gen_test_signal.py` — comprehensive A/B reference signal
  - `inref_scan.py` — kInputRef THD-vs-level fit
- **`docs/ui-peripheral-spec.md`** — full visual spec for the reusable UI elements.
- **`src/ui/`** — drop-in `PedalLookAndFeel`, `VUMeter`, `ThreePositionSwitch`, `LEDIndicator`,
  `PedalAssets` (BinaryData image/font accessors — see `docs/ui-noamp-assets.md`).
- **`src/utils/TaperUtils.h`** — taper helpers (note `audioTaperR0` for large gain pots).

## Build sequence (validate each step before the next — do not skip ahead)

1. **Schematic analysis** → fill `circuit.md`. Heed the schematic-reading gotchas there. Use the
   `schematic-checker` agent to cross-check any value/topology question against what's already
   captured, rather than re-reading the schematic image from scratch each time.
2. **CMake scaffold** — APVTS + AU/VST3 targets loading in a DAW.
3. **chowdsp_wdf smoke test** — trivial RC lowpass, confirm −3 dB point within 1% (offline/unit
   test, not a visual guess).
4. **Stage-by-stage DSP**, validated at each step:
   - Linear stages: frequency response vs expected transfer function.
   - Nonlinear stage: sine-clipping behaviour; confirm output polarity with a DC-step test.
   - Run the `dsp-validator` agent against each stage before moving to the next — it cross-checks
     component values, taper curves, and WDF topology against `circuit.md`/`dsp.md` for you.
5. **Switch topologies** — verify each position independently (precomputed scattering matrices).
   `dsp-validator` covers this too (topology + `setSMatrixData()` usage).
6. **Oversampling + ADAA** on the nonlinear stage — verify aliasing reduction. Use AccurateOmega
   (not chowdsp's default omega4). Add a separate render-time OS factor.
7. **Full-chain integration + level calibration** — anchor `kInputRef` from a real measurement;
   **calibrate output makeup to the reference captures** (may exceed 1.0; don't pad for headroom —
   calibration doc §2). Build an `OfflineRender` console exe mirroring `processBlock` for A/B.
8. **UI** — reuse the peripheral elements; design the centre pedal face per this pedal.
9. **Reference validation** — generate the comprehensive signal (`analysis/gen_test_signal.py`),
   capture the pedal per `docs/validation-and-capture.md`, and A/B with the harness: FR (1/3-oct),
   continuous swept-THD, null depth, knob-tracking pass/fail. Decompose any level deficit (§4)
   before changing constants.
10. **Final sweep** — all controls full range: no instability, clicks, or NaN/Inf. (Output > 0 dBFS
    at extreme drive+volume is faithful, not a fault — the output trim manages it.)

## Current step

> Update this at the start/end of each session so progress doesn't rely on conversation history.
> **CURRENT: Phase 10 CALIBRATION IN PROGRESS on V2 (2026-07-14). Next: clip WAVESHAPE + kOutputMakeup.**
> Full A/B harness now runs end-to-end (numpy/scipy present). Captures still 44.1k-in-48k-labeled

>
> - **HARNESS BUG FIXED:** `offline_render.cpp` wrote 24-bit INT → hard-clipped every >±1.0 FS render
>   (output ~+18 dB hot at `kOutputMakeup=1.0`), injecting a spurious kInputRef-independent ~24 % LF THD
>   floor that corrupted all THD/knee fits. Now **32-bit float**. Added calibration CLI overrides
>   (`--in-ref/--out-makeup/--zener-iref/-vzt/-cj/-vz/-vf/-m`) via `setDriveParams()` on V1LateDSP/V2DSP.
> - **`kInputRef` 0.87 → 1.3** (`Calibration.h`), fit from V2 clip onset (`inref_scan.py --metric linear`,
>   excl. max-drive). WORKING value; the onset SHAPE still mismatches (see waveshape open item).
> - **CLIP ASYMMETRY added** — `ZenerPairT` per-polarity knee mismatch `m` (+swing Vt(1+m)/−swing Vt(1−m),
>   same Is; `m=0` bit-identical, 23/23 ctest green). Adds the even harmonics the pedal has but a symmetric
>   pair lacks (V2 capture H2 ~−47/H4 ~−56 dB re fund; plugin ODD harmonics H3/H5/H7 already matched).
>   **V2 fit `m=0.015`** (`v2Params()`, two full-wet captures). V1L `m=0` (unfit). Null didn't move (evens
>   masked by the FR/level-limited ~−12 dB null) — correct structure fix, not a null-mover yet.
> - **OPEN, next:** (1) clip WAVESHAPE — plugin onset too ABRUPT + max-drive THD ceiling ~24 % vs pedal
>   ~37 % (structural; kInputRef/knee can't fix — suspects: stage-A `RailClip` hardness / zener knee at the
>   rail-starved 70–420 µA op current). (2) `kOutputMakeup` still 1.0 (V2 ~+18 dB hot, V1E ~+8 dB → the
>   ~10 dB gap = V2's +10.1 dB LEVEL stage). (3) V2 zener `Cj` still the V1L placeholder. (4) V1L/V1E
>   calibration not started (kInputRef fit off V2 only, per user's "use V2 as anchor").
> - **BLEND caveat:** judge WET-path FR/harmonics on full-wet (BL≈1.0) only — partial blend has dry+wet
>   top-octave phase-cancellation the plugin doesn't reproduce (reads as false "too bright").
>
> **Prior milestone: Phase 9 COMPLETE + ALL pre-Phase-10 items DONE (2026-07-13).**
> **#3 low-OS top-octave shelf DONE (2026-07-13):** `src/dsp/TopOctaveShelf.h` — one 2nd-order RBJ
> high-shelf (corner 8 kHz, +11 dB 1× plateau, Q 0.9), base-rate, inside each region
> (`V1EarlyDriveClipRecovery`/`ZenerDriveClipRecovery`) after downsampling. Corrects the recovery caps'
> low-OS bilinear top-octave droop; dB gain scaled per OS factor (1×:1.0, 2×:0.21, 4×:0.04, 8×:0 →
> transparent at the 4×/8× shipping defaults). One shared tuning for all three revs (droops differ
> ≤~3 dB). Achieves 1× net within ±2 dB through 10 kHz (raw was −6..−10), 12 kHz within ~2–5 dB, 16 kHz
> stays down (near-Nyquist zero uninvertible). Does NOT amplify aliasing (worst alias bins fold below
> the corner). Gated in `OSFidelity` Part A (now covers all three regions, asserted: 1× within ±3 dB
> @8–10 kHz, ~transparent at 4×). **#4 UI layout tuning DROPPED** — user reviewed renders and is happy
> with `layoutV1`/`layoutV2` as-is; no tuning pass needed.
>
> **#1 DAW listen (user):** user confirmed all three revisions react correctly by ear; the only note
> was V1E being quieter than V1L/V2 — confirmed FAITHFUL (V1E has +6.8 dB post-blend gain and a UNITY
> wet buffer, vs V1L's added +10.1 dB wet make-up buffer / V2's +10.1 dB LEVEL stage, plus V1E's lower
> +40 dB DRIVE ceiling vs +48 dB). The Phase-3/4/5.4/6/7/8 HARD-BREAK "nobody has listened" is closed.
> **#2 OS/ADAA on the V1L/V2 zener DRIVE (2026-07-13):** `ZenerDriveClipRecovery.h` (templated on the
> recovery-stage type) is the V1L/V2 analogue of `V1EarlyDriveClipRecovery` — oversamples the zener
> module + downstream recovery; `V1LateDSP`/`V2DSP` now use it (2-loop processBlock w/ buffered dry tap,
> like V1E), so `setOversamplingFactor`/`setADAA`/`getLatencySamples` are LIVE (no longer no-ops).
> `ZenerDriveModule` gained the stage-A op-amp RAIL clip (`railA`, ADAA'd; the zener is NOT ADAA'd —
> relies on OS+AccurateOmega). **Gate: `OSFidelity` Part C — zener aliasing drops 42.9 dB (1x -51.8 →
> 8x -94.7 dB) while wanted THD stays flat ~-5.3 dB.** `V1LateIntegrationTest`/`V2IntegrationTest` are
> now JUCE console apps (OS region needs juce::dsp). **DURABLE clip-behaviour change:** the stage-A rail
> current-limits the zener (stage B is inverting, I_g=V_w/(R_wb+R17)), so the clip is now DRIVE-DEPENDENT
> — max-drive ceiling dropped 3.85→3.54 V (rail caps V_w at 4.2 V → only ~420 µA into the zener even at
> max, so it sits just below its rated knee), and mid-drive is softer still (~3.06 V). This is more
> faithful, but the symmetric ±4.2 V rail is a placeholder — real V1L stage A self-biases at ~0.69·VCC
> (asymmetric +2.6/−5.8 V), a Phase-10 calibration lever affecting mid-drive softness + even harmonics.
> All 23 ctest green. `PerfBenchmark`/`OSFidelity`/README performance table updated (V1L/V2 now scale
> with OS: 1.4→7.8% CPU, 0→65-sample latency).
>
> **Prior Phase 9:** `PerfBenchmark`/`FeatureProfile`/`OSFidelity` built and registered
> as `add_test()`; README gained a "Performance" section with the measured table.
> **FeatureProfile measured — no HQ toggle added**, contrary to the speculated carry-forward below:
> the zener-clip omega solver (`AccurateOmega` vs chowdsp `omega4`) costs ~2.7x CPU, but omega4's
> distortion floor never exceeds what the zener's own circuit curvature already produces at any
> realistic drive (0.0 dB gap at real operating amplitudes; only a small, inaudible 6.7 dB gap between
> two already-far-below-audible floors at truly tiny signal) — so `AccurateOmega` stays the shipping
> default (already cheap in absolute per-sample terms) with no toggle needed. Rail-clip ADAA confirmed
> a genuine free win (~7.6 dB less 1x aliasing for ~3.4 ns/sample, i.e. always-on, no toggle). To make
> the omega A/B possible, `ZenerFeedbackClipper` (`ZenerPairT.h`) is now templated on `OmegaProvider`
> (defaulted `AccurateOmega`, production behavior unchanged) — a small additive change; update any new
> call site to `ZenerFeedbackClipper<>`. **OSFidelity confirmed the known low-OS top-octave droop is
> real** (V1 Early: ~-5.7/-13.1/-25.7 dB @ 8k/12k/16k Hz at 1x vs the 8x reference, shrinking ~4x per
> OS doubling; THD stays flat across factors, confirming pure discretisation, not a clip-fidelity
> issue) — no prewarp/shelf is implemented yet; this is data for that follow-up decision, not a fix.
> **`.clang-format` was silently out of sync with the actual codebase** (said `BreakBeforeBraces:
> Attach`; every file actually used Allman/brace-on-own-line) — fixed (`Allman`, unindented access
> modifiers, left pointer/reference alignment, spaced C-casts) and ran a real pass across
> `src/`+`tests/` (whitespace/brace-shape only — verified via diff and a full rebuild; 22/22 tests

> embedded program interface (`getNumPrograms`/`setCurrentProgram`/`getProgramName`) reading
> `src/FactoryPresets.h` (single source of truth: clock-face→0..1 helper `clk()`, 12 V1 rows ×
> {Early,Late} + 12 V2 rows, grouped/prefixed names). Sets only revision+pots+V2 switches (leaves
> trims/OS/bypass); not tied into state (raw params already persist). `tests/FactoryPresetsTest`
> registered (23/23 ctest green). **Switch convention locked: "In" = HIGHER silk freq** → mid_shift
> "1000 Hz"/bass_shift "80 Hz" (index 1); Out = index 0. Plugin is frequency-native (choice param +

> ## ✅ ALL PRE-PHASE-10 ITEMS DONE — see CURRENT for #1 listen / #2 OS-ADAA / #3 shelf / #4 UI-dropped

> **Phase 10 itself (capture-gated, cannot start until the user provides captures):** re-anchor

> **Durable gotchas from Phase 6 (still relevant to future NodalCircuit/switch-stage work):**
> (1) **Switch modelling is NOT `setSMatrixData()`** — V2's MID/BASS-SHIFT stages are NodalCircuit
> (MNA), so "switched topology" = a resistor toggled `kSwitchShort`(0.5Ω)/`kSwitchOpen`(1e12Ω) +
> `rebuild()` (rare, not per-block). (2) **ANY hand-derived analytic MNA reference:** when an
> op-amp's (+) input node is a bare passive junction and the buffered OUTPUT is a separate node
> forced to the same voltage, a positive-feedback cap returning to that output must NOT be included
> in the (+) node's own KCL row — its current is absorbed by the op-amp's output (an ideal source),
> not the high-Z input node; `NodalCircuit::addOpAmp`'s nullor stamping already handles this, only a
> hand-derived reference has to do it explicitly. (3) A peaking DEEP CUT that nulls at very low freq
> needs a long settle window in a sine-sweep measurement, or a not-yet-decayed transient reads as a
> too-shallow cut (measurement artifact, not a discretisation error). (4) `WDFParallelT`/pot legs at
> a literal 0 Ω → NaN; floor parallel-adaptor pot legs at 0.5 Ω. (5) `NodalCircuit::addOpAmp` does
> NOT support `kInput` as the (+) node (silently drops the input term → floating output); route
> input via a component into an internal node first, or wire the next component straight to
> `kInput` if nothing drops voltage before it — and when a series R develops no drop into a high-Z
> (+) input, skip the redundant node entirely (V1LateOutputStage/V2BlendLevelStage/V2OutputStage
> pattern) rather than modelling an inert buffer stage.
> **Carry-forward from 5.3 — CLOSED (2026-07-13, see CURRENT #2):** the two DRIVE stages (CH34-9/CH40)
> are CASCADED not simultaneous (wiper = stiff source); Cj=220pF fit (V1L, and provisionally V2 —
> `v2Params()==v1LateParams()`, still a Phase-10 fit target). The zener DRIVE module + recovery now
> oversample (`ZenerDriveClipRecovery`) and the stage-A rail clip is added+ADAA'd. Remaining Phase-10
> work on this stage: fit V2's Cj/knee independently, and the asymmetric stage-A rail (see CURRENT).

- **Source material**: three Japanese-language reverse-engineering blog posts by kanengomibako
  (unofficial, non-commercial-use-only schematics) — see `circuit.md` header for URLs. All three
  schematics + per-control frequency-response sim reference images are saved under `schematics/
  {v1-early,v1-late,v2}/`, plus 2×-upscaled quadrant crops under `schematics/crops/` (and FR-graph
  reading copies under `schematics/crops/fr/`) for anything `circuit.md` doesn't already capture.
  The FR graphs are quantitatively transcribed into `docs/reference-fr-targets.md`.
- **2nd-pass verification done** (Opus): re-traced the schematics and re-read every FR graph. Two
  first-draft errors fixed in `circuit.md` — (1) LEVEL is a **post-BLEND master level**, not a
  dry-path level (corrected signal order: PRESENCE→DRIVE→…→BLEND→LEVEL→[V2 MID]→BASS→TREBLE→out);
  (2) the mid "notch" is actually **two** features — a deep ~800 Hz character notch (input twin-T,
  all revisions) vs a gentle ~430 Hz bridged-T mid-cut (V1e/V1l only, removed on V2). Everything
  else in the first-pass transcription verified correct.
- **Headline finding**: the three revisions differ far more than component values — V1 Early has
  **no clipping diodes at all** in the drive stage (op-amp rail saturation only); V1 Late and V2
  both use a small zener-clipping sub-module (different zener part number each: `DZ23C3V3` vs
  `BZB984-C3V3`, same 3.3 V back-to-back topology) needing bespoke WDF treatment (reverse zener
  breakdown isn't what `chowdsp_wdf`'s `DiodePairT`/`DiodeT` model) — **now built (Phase 4,
  `ZenerPairT.h`); see the Phase-4 carry-forward below.** Tone stack topology also changes: V1 Early is
  Baxandall shelving, V1 Late/V2 are peaking, and V2 adds a whole new MID control (post-blend,
  switchable center freq) plus a BASS-frequency-shift switch neither V1 revision has.
- **3rd-pass verification (Fable) resolved every open schematic item** — see `circuit.md`
  Validation notes: the `IC3A` `?` is an IC part-number caveat (not wiring; DRIVE gain
  1+330k/3.3k = +40.1 dB matches the FR sim exactly, cross-validating the transcription); V2
  MID/MID-SHIFT and BASS-SHIFT are Baxandall peaking stages with DPDT cap-toggling wiper legs
  (SW4A half unused); both output switches short a 22k feedback R → closed = unity = the throw we
  model (open = +10.1 dB = LINE/"+10dB", matching panel labels numerically). Remaining genuinely
  open work: the zener WDF element (planned research spike) and capture-anchored calibration.
- **4th pass (Fable): node-level netlists for every stage, all three revisions, now in
  `.claude/rules/netlists.md`** — DSP tasks read their stage's netlist, never a schematic image.
  Headline finds: V1L/V2 **DRIVE pot is shared between two coupled inverting module stages**
  (wiper = stage-A output; validated numerically: +12.9/+48.6 dB vs FR §4's +12.5/+48);
  V1L/V2 presence = pot-in-feedback (different cell from V1e's rheostat-leg); V1L LEVEL =
  single inverting stage with 100k-loaded wiper (taper interacts); dry tap = input-buffer
  OUTPUT on all three; recovery = unity Sallen-Key LPF pairs. circuit.md's affected Function
  cells are annotated; **netlists.md wins on conflict**. Residual `[◐]` items each carry a
  named FR self-validation gate (e.g. V1L C10/R14 wet-HP read → check §1 LF before trusting).
- **Locked decisions** (do not re-litigate; full table in `docs/build-plan.md`): one plugin with an
  automatable `revision` choice param + per-revision UI face; V1 Early built first; **three DSP
  graph classes** sharing primitives; identity = Leigh Pierce / `LPrc` / `NALR` /
  `com.leighpierce.noamplowriderdi` (reuse `LPrc` on future pedals).
- **DSP method (decided Phase 1, user chose "most accurate").** Passive bridge/twin-T stages use
  chowdsp R-type adaptors with a scattering matrix computed **numerically** from topology + live port
  impedances (`src/dsp/RtypeNumeric.h`, `S = 2·Aᵀ(A·Gd·Aᵀ)⁻¹·A·Gd − I`, wave conv `v=(a+b)/2,
  i=(a−b)/2R` verified vs chowdsp) — no hand-transcribed matrices. Non-inverting op-amp *gain* stages
  use the ideal-op-amp decomposition (`src/dsp/OpAmpStage.h`). **Op-amp-embedded LINEAR stages where
  the output feeds back into its own input network** (active Sallen-Key, inverting tone/gain — 1.3
  onward) use a bilinear-companion **MNA engine** (`src/dsp/NodalCircuit.h`, ideal op-amps as
  nullors): identical accuracy to WDF for linear circuits, far lower silent-error surface than a
  hand-rolled nullor scattering matrix. WDF wave-domain stays reserved for the Phase-4 nonlinear
  zener (its real edge). Validate every stage vs an independent frequency-domain reference — for
  bilinear engines, compare at the **warp-compensated** frequency `fa=(fs/π)tan(πf/fs)` to isolate
  correctness from top-octave warp — **and** the FR §-targets. NodalCircuit gotcha (cost real time):
  an input-coupled cap injects `+Gc·vin` into the far node (same sign as a resistor); a grounded-cap
  RC self-check will NOT catch this sign — the bridged-T (input-coupled cap) did.
- **Two plan-gate expectations were idealized; the faithful models (confirmed vs complex MNA to
  <0.01 dB) reveal the real behaviour — trust the model, not the naive gate:** (1) BLEND off-side
  isolation is NOT `<-80 dB` — it's cap-impedance-limited (C1 72 Ω / C12 3.4k at 1 kHz vs the 100k
  pot), so ~−22..−56 dB, asymmetric, frequency-dependent (a real blend pot leaks the off-side; more
  faithful than an ideal crossfade). (2) The output buffer (E8) is NOT unity/~6 Hz — it has a fixed
  **−0.85 dB insertion loss** (R33 1k / R29 10k divider; **feed this into output-makeup calibration
  Phase 3/10**) and a **~13 Hz** DC-block corner (cascade of two 2.2 µF sections, higher than the
  netlist's rough "~6 Hz"); flat within 0.25 dB only above ~60–80 Hz.
- **§3 `fr_presence_drive` is the op-amp gain block ALONE, no twin-T notch** — validate PRESENCE/DRIVE
  gain (1+Zf/Zg) against §3 (min +12.2 / mid +16.7 / max +34.2 dB @ 4.8 kHz, peak migrates 864→4829
  Hz ✓), the notch against §1. **RESOLVED: the twin-T (~−24 dB stage-level) reaches §1's −36.3 dB @
  ~715 Hz once the recovery superposes (full wet path, 1.3) — the twin-T was correct; no revisit
  needed.** §1's ~−9 dB LF edge still needs the downstream BLEND (C12) + tone (C25) coupling HPs (1.4/1.5).
- **Phase 2 (V1E nonlinearity) findings.** (1) Rail clip = **±4.2 V** about VCOM (matches the locked
  power constant; the build-plan §2.1 "±4.5 V" text is STALE — forgets D5). Hard clamp (rail-to-rail
  TLC226x), 1st-order ADAA, exact piecewise antiderivative — `RailClip.h`. (2) **Recovery DC gain =
  0.6875** (IC3C R17/R12 = 22/32 input attenuator, the −3.3 dB): the DRIVE→recovery region OUTPUT =
  (clip-node volts)×0.6875, so at full drive it saturates at ≈±4.2·0.6875 = ±2.89 V, NOT ±4.2 —
  **feed this recovery attenuation into Phase-3/10 output-makeup calibration**. (3) Gate results: 4×
  OS aliasing is below the −94 dB measurement floor (1× genuine −79 dB alias driven to the floor by
  OS); ADAA cuts 1× aliasing by ~22 dB. (4) **Prewarp DEFERRED to Phase 9**: on V1E the dominant HF
  (cab-sim) caps live in the oversampled DRIVE→recovery region so they're correctly NOT prewarped;
  every remaining base-rate HF corner is knob-swept (presence peak, tone-pot shelves — dsp.md forbids
  prewarping swept corners) EXCEPT the one fixed tone-stack feedback corner **C29 ~7.2 kHz** (sub-dB)
  — record it as the single deferred prewarp target, to be tuned with the low-OS shelf against
  `OSFidelity` (don't perturb the gated 1.5 stage blind now).
- **Phase 3 (integration) facts for Phase 10 calibration.** (1) Provisional constants in
  `src/dsp/Calibration.h`: **kInputRef = 0.87 V/FS** (2026-07-13, user request: carried over from
  the author's prior same-template project, monarch-of-tone's real-capture-calibrated
  `circuitVoltsPerFS` — a different circuit's own clip-onset anchor, so still NOT measured for THIS
  pedal; a better-grounded provisional stand-in than the old 3.27 doc worked-example, not a final
  value), **kOutputMakeup = 1.0** (interim). Both re-anchored from NoAmp's own captures in Phase 10 —
  don't treat as final. (2) **LEVEL is modelled INSIDE the DSP** (the pedal's LEVEL pot, in V1EarlyBlendLevelStage),
  so there is NO separate `volumeGain` scalar in the processor — output gain = `kOutputMakeup ·
  dbToGain(outTrim) / kInputRef` only (`outputGainFor()`). Don't go looking for a volume taper to
  fit; LEVEL's law is the circuit. (3) Measured dry-path (blend=0) gain at LEVEL noon = **−0.70 dB**
  (integration test) — near-unity, consistent with the −0.85 dB output-buffer loss; confirms the
  dry-tap→BLEND→LEVEL→tone→output wiring and that kInputRef cancels in the linear path. (4) Processor
  gotcha resolved: per-sample SmoothedValue advanced per-channel ramps 2× too fast in stereo and
  desyncs L/R — precompute the input-trim/output-gain/bypass ramps ONCE per block into shared arrays,
  index both channels into them.
- **Phase 4 (zener clip) — RESOLVED the one open WDF research item.** `ZenerPairT.h`:
  antiparallel-pair is `I=2·Is·sinh(V/Vt)` → reuse Werner eqn-18 (DiodePairT `Good`-form) with
  `(Is,Vt)` reparameterised from the zener knee, honouring `nalr::AccurateOmega` (NOT omega4). Cj =
  `CapacitorT` in parallel (pair caps in series → ~half a device's Cd → "~100 pF class"; sets the §4
  DRIVE HF rolloff). `ZenerFeedbackClipper` (`Ig∥Rf∥Cj∥zener`, `vOut=−V_fb`) is the reusable stage
  Phase 5's V1L/V2 drive module drops in (same class both revs; differ only in Rf/Cj/coupling +
  zener knee). **Params (fit, refine in Phase 10): `Vz 3.3, Vf 0.65, Vzt 0.20, Iref 5 mA` → Vth≈3.95.**
  **Softness TRAP that cost real time: do NOT set `Vzt` from the datasheet `r_dif` (~0.5 V) — that
  single-exp is so leaky it kills the small-signal linear gain and clamps soft at ~2.4 V; use the
  sharper ~0.20 V (clean linear region, holds near the 3.3 V rating).** Not yet OS/ADAA'd (Phase 6).
- **The build plan lives in `docs/build-plan.md`** — per-task model (Opus 4.8 vs Sonnet 5) + effort
  assignments, exact read-lists per task (token discipline), and numeric validation gates keyed to
  `docs/reference-fr-targets.md` §§. UI visuals are validated by the user (send PNGs, never
  self-review screenshots); captures arrive later and only Phase 10 depends on them.
- **UI asset/layout groundwork built ahead of schedule (2026-07-12, out of phase order — DSP was
  mid-Phase-6 at the time)**, at the user's request, so the pedal face is ready once Phase 7's
  revision-switching lands. Full detail in `docs/ui-noamp-assets.md`; headline: `PedalLookAndFeel`/
  `LEDIndicator`/`ThreePositionSwitch` all gained an *optional* bitmap-override path (vector drawing
  stays the default/fallback — `ui.md`), fed by a new `src/ui/PedalAssets.{h,cpp}` + `NoAmpAssets`
  CMake binary-data target embedding the user's photographic knob/switch/LED/footswitch sprites,
  three per-revision faceplate textures, and the Anton display font (OFL). Wordmark reskinned to
  "NoAmp"/"LOW RIDER DI" (the reference layout images are Tech21's actual faceplate — replicate the
  physical layout only, not their wordmark). `tests/UIRenderProbe.cpp` headlessly renders all 3
  revisions × 3 UI scales to PNG for review. **All knob/control positions in `PluginEditor`'s
  `layoutV1`/`layoutV2` are first-pass eyeballed estimates** — expect a tuning pass once the user
  reviews renders (normal per `build-plan.md`'s Phase 8 iterate loop, not a follow-up bug).
