# NoAmp Low Rider DI — Project Memory  (from the pedal-plugin template)

> NoAmp Low Rider DI is a circuit-level emulation of the **Tech 21 SansAmp Bass Driver DI (BDDI)**
> built as an AU/VST3 plugin using JUCE 8+ and chowdsp_wdf WDF modelling. Unlike most pedals built
> from this template, this project models **three selectable circuit revisions of the same pedal**
> — V1 Early, V1 Late, and V2 — sharing reusable DSP/UI primitives where practical. DI/line-out/XLR
> circuitry and phantom-power handling are explicitly out of scope; only the instrument-level 1/4"
> output path is modelled (see `circuit.md`'s scope decision).
> Author/Company: Leigh Pierce

This project was scaffolded from a reusable template. The generic, hard-won engineering lives in
the rules + docs below — read them before writing DSP or UI.

## Quick reference

```
Build:  cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build
AU:     cmake --build build --target NoAmpLowRiderDI_AU     (auto-installs; bump VERSION to force Logic rescan)
Format: clang-format -i src/**/*.{cpp,h}
```

## Schematics

Schematic images + FR sim graphs live in `schematics/`; they are transcribed/verified into
`.claude/rules/circuit.md` (component values + roles), `.claude/rules/netlists.md` (**node-level
per-stage connectivity — what a WDF task actually builds from**), and `docs/reference-fr-targets.md`
(quantitative FR targets). **Never re-read the schematic PNGs** — four verification passes are done
(values 3×, node wiring 1×, with numeric cross-checks); the only flagged residual ambiguities are
tagged `[◐]` in `netlists.md` with a named FR self-validation gate each, so even those resolve
without images.

**Use the `schematic-checker` agent any time a circuit value or topology is in doubt; use
`dsp-validator` after any DSP stage change.** Both read `circuit.md`/`dsp.md` — keep those current.

## Rule / reference files — READ ON DEMAND, not auto-loaded

> These are **deliberately NOT `@`-included** (that would auto-load ~19k tokens — dominated by the
> 11k-token `circuit.md` — into *every* session, defeating the per-task reading discipline the build
> plan depends on). Each task in `docs/build-plan.md` lists the exact files + sections to read. Load
> only those. `circuit.md` especially is a per-revision reference: a V1-Early task reads the V1-Early
> tables, not the whole file.

| File | Read when |
|------|-----------|
| `.claude/rules/circuit.md` | any DSP/circuit task — **only the relevant revision's tables + cited notes** |
| `.claude/rules/netlists.md` | any WDF/stage-building task — **only that revision's stage section(s)**; node-level wiring + per-stage gates. Wins over circuit.md's Function cells on conflict |
| `.claude/rules/dsp.md` | any DSP task (WDF/ADAA/oversampling/omega) |
| `.claude/rules/architecture.md` | processor-level / threading / APVTS / integration tasks |
| `.claude/rules/build.md` | CMake / CI / test-harness tasks |
| `.claude/rules/ui.md` + `docs/ui-peripheral-spec.md` | UI tasks |
| `docs/ui-noamp-assets.md` | pedal-face layout/asset tasks — this pedal's bitmap-asset map, font, wordmark, per-revision layout |
| `docs/reference-fr-targets.md` | any linear-stage validation (the FR gates cite its §§) |
| `docs/calibration-and-gain-staging.md` | level/rail/makeup calibration tasks |
| `docs/validation-and-capture.md` | capture-based validation (Phase 10) |
| `analysis/README.md` | full A/B harness + diagnostic scripts reference (Phase 10) |
| `docs/build-plan.md` | **start here** — the phased plan with per-task model + read-list + gates |

## Essential reading (template learnings — do not skip)

- **`docs/calibration-and-gain-staging.md`** — input-load (`kInputRef`) calibration, output-makeup
  calibration (level-match to captures — NOT a ~0.9 headroom pad; see §2), the DRIVE taper-floor
  bug, output-load (negligible), internal-vs-output clipping, op-amp rails, VU idle gate. This is
  where the non-obvious time-sinks are documented.
- **`docs/reference-fr-targets.md`** — **(project-specific)** quantitative frequency-response targets
  for every stage/control on all three revisions, transcribed from the author's SPICE sim graphs.
  The first-pass validation reference for every linear stage — available before any real capture.
- **`docs/validation-and-capture.md`** — how to measure how close the plugin is to the real pedal
  (1/6-oct+densified FR read across a 5-level sweep bank, continuous Farina swept-THD, sub-sample
  null, knob-tracking pass/fail) and how to
  CAPTURE the pedal so the measurement is trustworthy (bypass anchor, one-knob-at-a-time, sweep
  Volume, no truncation). The capture MATRIX, not the signal, is the usual limitation.
- **`analysis/`** — the reusable harness plus Phase-10 diagnostic scripts. ALWAYS write analysis
  commands as standalone scripts in `analysis/` (never as inline Python in a tool call — inline
  commands block the terminal on long-running harmonic/THD scans, and the output can't be
  recovered mid-execution). Use `analyze.py` + `noamp_captures.py` as the library layer.
  Existing analysis scripts (run from repo root with python3.11):
  - `ab_report.py` — full A/B across all captures (FR, THD, null depth, level)
  - `harmonic_report.py` — per-harmonic H2..H7 vs pedal (diagnostic)
  - `sat_calibrate.py` — 3D sweep of sat-gain/sat-knee/sat-offset values
  - `vzt_sweep.py` — zener knee softness scan
  - `rail_knee_sweep.py` — RailClip parabolic knee scan
  - `asymmetry_check.py` — zener asymmetry m-factor vs pedal H2
  - `check_asym_sources.py` — asymmetric rails vs sat-offset comparison
  - `cj_scan.py` — zener junction capacitance fit
  - `sat_sweep.py` / `sat_sweep2.py` — recovery saturation gain/knee scans
  - `verify_sat_fix.py` — verify calibrated saturation offset params
  - `gen_test_signal.py` — comprehensive A/B reference signal
  - `inref_scan.py` — kInputRef THD-vs-level fit
  - `gapd_memoryless_impossibility.py` — ⭐ **the proof that memory is required** (no renders, no model)
  - `gapd_fit_harness.py` — ⭐ **the Gap D JOINT scorer** (V2 level axis + V1L drive axis pooled;
    enforces guardrail #6 by REGRET, scores THD *and* compression, L-009 + clamp guards wired in)
  - `gapd_module_tau_screen.py` — time-constant screen of the whole zener-module element set (paper only)
  - `zener_model_vs_datasheet.py` — zener knee r_dif vs the DZ23C3V3 datasheet (paper only)
  - `gapd_vzt_authority.py` — knee-softness ablation sweep with liveness + V1E controls
  - `gapd_locus_reachability.py` — ⚠ SUPERSEDED, do not cite (its own pooling control failed)
  - `proto_hf_restore.py` — Gap D HF feasibility paper-test (no renders); superseded by the next one
  - `gapd_hf_restore_fit.py` — ⭐ the shipped `HFEvenRestore` joint fit (11 captures × 3 revisions,
    render-and-score harness mirroring `v1e_even_fit.py`; `--quick` for a fast 1-capture/rev grid)
  - `v1l_gapd_tauscz_sweep.py` — `ClipDriveNormaliser` tau/scHz check, V1L-DRIVE axis only (V2 is
    physically inert to this layer, so no guardrail #6 join needed); confirmed shipped values optimal
- **`docs/ui-peripheral-spec.md`** — full visual spec for the reusable UI elements.
- **`src/ui/`** — drop-in `PedalLookAndFeel`, `VUMeter`, `ThreePositionSwitch`, `LEDIndicator`,
  `PedalAssets` (BinaryData image/font accessors — see `docs/ui-noamp-assets.md`).
- **`src/utils/TaperUtils.h`** — taper helpers (note `audioTaperR0` for large gain pots).

## Build sequence (validate each step before the next — do not skip ahead)

1. **Schematic analysis** → fill `circuit.md`. Heed the schematic-reading gotchas there. Use the
   `schematic-checker` agent to cross-check any value/topology question against what's already
   captured, rather than re-reading the schematic image from scratch each time.
2. **CMake scaffold** — APVTS + AU/VST3 targets loading in a DAW.
3. **chowdsp_wdf smoke test** — trivial RC lowpass, confirm −3 dB point within 1% (offline/unit
   test, not a visual guess).
4. **Stage-by-stage DSP**, validated at each step:
   - Linear stages: frequency response vs expected transfer function.
   - Nonlinear stage: sine-clipping behaviour; confirm output polarity with a DC-step test.
   - Run the `dsp-validator` agent against each stage before moving to the next — it cross-checks
     component values, taper curves, and WDF topology against `circuit.md`/`dsp.md` for you.
5. **Switch topologies** — verify each position independently (precomputed scattering matrices).
   `dsp-validator` covers this too (topology + `setSMatrixData()` usage).
6. **Oversampling + ADAA** on the nonlinear stage — verify aliasing reduction. Use AccurateOmega
   (not chowdsp's default omega4). Add a separate render-time OS factor.
7. **Full-chain integration + level calibration** — anchor `kInputRef` from a real measurement;
   **calibrate output makeup to the reference captures** (may exceed 1.0; don't pad for headroom —
   calibration doc §2). Build an `OfflineRender` console exe mirroring `processBlock` for A/B.
8. **UI** — reuse the peripheral elements; design the centre pedal face per this pedal.
9. **Reference validation** — generate the comprehensive signal (`analysis/gen_test_signal.py`),
   capture the pedal per `docs/validation-and-capture.md`, and A/B with the harness: FR (1/3-oct),
   continuous swept-THD, null depth, knob-tracking pass/fail. Decompose any level deficit (§4)
   before changing constants.
10. **Final sweep** — all controls full range: no instability, clicks, or NaN/Inf. (Output > 0 dBFS
    at extreme drive+volume is faithful, not a fault — the output trim manages it.)

## Current step

>
> **✅ GAP H err2 CLOSED 2026-07-22 (later session, no code change) — the "decide by ear, LAST" bucket

> V2 stays off (`kWetTopDbV2 = 0.0`), same status as before. Full detail in the gap table's H err2

>
> **✅ THE V1L 1613–3225 Hz THD OVERSHOOT IS CLOSED BEST-EFFORT (2026-07-23). IT WAS NEVER ONE
> DEFECT — IT SPLITS BY BLEND INTO TWO MECHANISMS, AND THE ONE REMAINING LEVER IS REFUTED BY
> MEASUREMENT. NO C++ SHIPPED; V1L/V1E/V2 ALL BIT-IDENTICAL. Do not re-open without a new idea.**
> The band was the last item CLAUDE.md still described as "a SEPARATE, still-open question... NOT
> exhausted". It is now exhausted. Four capture-based diagnostics, each answering the previous one's
> question; 33/33 ctest green.
> - **⛔ `ClipDriveNormaliser` CANNOT DO IT — AN AUTHORITY RULE-OUT, so no grid refinement can rescue
>   it** (`analysis/v1l_midband_drive_joint_refit.py`, a 20-point target×scHz joint search over V1L's
>   OWN two axes). Across the whole grid the midband moves **0.84 dB** while its own 440 Hz axis moves
>   **11.97 dB** — **14.3× less leverage on the band we want**. Its best-possible midband gain is
>   **0.75 dB of a 7.56 dB residual (9.9%)** and costs **+11.94 dB** on the SHIPPED, GATED 440 Hz axis
>   (`V1LateGapDTest`). Guardrail #6 regret fails (drive440 +2.47 dB). Same class of argument that
>   killed C42 and PRESENCE in Gap H. ⚠ Note V2 is correctly **excluded by ARCHITECTURE** here, not by
>   parameter matching — `V2DSP::prepare()` never calls `setClipDriveNormalisation`.
> - **⛔ THE BLEND DISCREPANCY EXPLAINS ~20%, NOT THE BAND** (`analysis/v1l_midband_blend_decompose.py`).
>   The residual DOES fall with blend and the sweep **turns** (a genuine interior optimum, not the
>   documented edge non-result): 0.30→12.01, 0.15→7.65, 0.10→4.75, **0.07→2.93, 0.05→2.86**, 0.03→5.06.
>   But nulling it needs **blend 0.30 → ~0.06 = −0.24 = 2.4 CLOCK-HOURS**, against the **−0.05..−0.10**
>   that two independent estimators measured (`v1l_blend_knob_probe` null-based; `v1l_blend_balance`
>   α ⇒ 0.19–0.21). At the corroborated shift it explains **~20%**, and **the level-GROWTH shape
>   survives at every blend** (+4.90 dB even at 0.03) ⇒ blend shaves magnitude, it is not the
>   mechanism. **🆕 A THIRD INDEPENDENT CORROBORATION OF THE MODEST WET-LEVEL EXCESS, though:** the
>   BL0.65 capture shows an interior optimum at blend **0.55 (−0.10)**, matching `v1l_blend_knob_probe`'s
>   null-derived −0.10 **exactly**, on a completely different observable (midband THD vs null depth).
> - **⭐⭐ THE REAL FINDING — THE BAND SPLITS BY BLEND INTO TWO DIFFERENT MECHANISMS.** Compression read
>   WITHIN each file (so NAM level normalisation cancels) against the THD residual:
>
>   | capture | compression resid | THD resid @−6 dBFS | reading |
>   |---|---|---|---|
>   | BL1.00 | **+4.53 / +3.13 dB** | +2.83 / −3.33 | we UNDER-COMPRESS; THD ~ok |
>   | BL0.65 | **+4.91 / +4.73 dB** | +1.49 / +1.50 | we UNDER-COMPRESS; THD ~ok |
>   | BL0.30 | **+0.32 / +0.23 dB** | **+11.71 / +18.79** | compression MATCHES, THD far too HOT |
>
>   BL1.00/BL0.65 carry **Gap I's onset floor** — on the SHAPE evidence only. The midband residual
>   shrinks with driven level on every V1E capture (fresh renders: −2.9 / −1.7 / −0.5 dB across
>   −18→−6), which is the onset-floor signature in its own right.
>   - **⚠ SELF-CORRECTION (2026-07-23, same session) — I FIRST CLAIMED A STRONGER CO-VARIATION
>     COROBORATION AND IT DOES NOT HOLD ON THE CURRENT CHAIN. This is L-005, committed inside a
>     session that cites L-005.** The claim ("110 Hz Gap I anchor and the 1613/2032 Hz residual
>     co-vary in sign, trend AND rank across all three V1E captures") was read off
>     `comprehensive_data.json` generated **2026-07-21 02:57**, which predates BOTH `HFEvenRestore`
>     (shared by all three revisions) and — decisively — the **`kInputRef[V1E]` 7.0 → 6.0 re-fit of
>     2026-07-22**. Re-measured on FRESH renders, **sign and trend agreement FAIL on 2 of 3 captures**
>     (only rank order survives): 110 Hz now reads D0.50 +3.3→+0.6, **D0.60 −0.6→+0.4**, D1.00
>     −0.1→+0.1, against the stale +11.7 / +4.1 / −0.0. **The staging re-fit largely CLOSED V1E's
>     110 Hz onset floor while leaving the midband residual untouched** — which is *weaker* evidence
>     for "one mechanism", not stronger: were they the same thing, fixing the staging should have
>     moved both. ⇒ the Gap I attribution for BL1.00/BL0.65 rests on the level-trend SHAPE alone,
>     and the cross-anchor unification is **NOT established on the current chain**. Do not re-quote
>     the co-variation figures. Tool: **`analysis/v1e_midband_onset_covariation.py`** (fresh renders,
>     reads no JSON by design — the whole point is that the JSON is not the chain).
>   BL0.30 is the **memoryless-impossibility signature** instead — equal compression must imply equal
>   THD for ANY memoryless element, so ~12–19 dB of excess harmonics at matched compression is Gap D's
>   V2-half signature appearing on V1L.
>   - **✅ AND THAT READING SURVIVED ITS OWN POWER CHECK — which is what makes it evidence.** BL0.30 is
>     70% dry, so "compression matches" could just mean the dry leg pins `dGain`. It does not:
>     perturbing the WET leg (gapd makeup 1.0→0.0) moves the same metric **4.82/4.73 dB at BL0.30** vs
>     **5.19/5.18 at BL1.00** — ~93% of full-wet sensitivity retained, and the measured 0.23–0.32 dB
>     match sits **~15–20× below it**. (Bounding the metric's power first is the Gap H err2 lesson.)
> - **⛔ AND THE MECHANISM-MATCHED FIX IS REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT — `ClipHarmonicReducer` ON V1L. DO NOT
>   BUILD IT** (`analysis/v1l_midband_chr_feasibility.py`; the layer already exists on the SHARED
>   `ZenerDriveClipRecovery`, only the CLI gated it off V1L). It has **real authority at unchanged
>   compression** — slope 0.3/betaMax 0.7/scHz 3000 closes **64%** of BL0.30's residual (12.01 → 4.31),
>   compression moves **+0.03 dB**, and BOTH guards IMPROVE. **It still fails guardrail #6 outright on
>   that same setting: BL1.00 3.18 → 5.91 (+2.73), BL0.65 0.85 → 7.66 (+6.81).** The reason is
>   structural, not a tuning miss — the two regressing captures are exactly the ones WITHOUT the
>   impossibility signature, so a harmonic reducer strips harmonics they NEED. **The required
>   correction is ~0 for two captures and ~12 dB for one = a per-capture value by definition**, and a
>   blend-tracking version is the per-KNOB form #6 also forbids. On the ONE capture that shows it, it
>   is further confounded with the already-closed blend/wet-level discrepancy, and **the matrix is
>   FINAL** (V1L has exactly one identifiable low-blend file) so the two can never be separated.
> - **⚠ L-009 FIRED AND SAVED THE RESULT.** The first feasibility run reported `--chr-*` as a **DEAD
>   SWITCH on V1L (max|delta| = 0.000e+00)** — `V1LateDSP` had no pass-through setter at all and
>   `applyChr(d)` was only wired into OfflineRender's V2 branch, so every number would have been a
>   silent no-op. Fixed, **re-verified live (6.75e-02)**, and V1L confirmed **BIT-IDENTICAL** without
>   the flag. Third time this project has been bitten by this class — the guard is worth its cost.
> - **⇒ DISPOSITION: CLOSED BEST-EFFORT.** BL1.00/BL0.65 → absorbed into **Gap I** (unfixable by any
>   memoryless nonlinearity, already documented). BL0.30 → real, correctly diagnosed, and **not
>   correctable within the guardrails on the evidence that exists**. The two diagnostic hooks added
>   (`V1LateDSP::setClipHarmonicReduction`, the OfflineRender V1L ungate) are **inert and verified
>   bit-identical** — kept so this is re-measurable, with the refutation recorded in
>   `V1LateDSP.h`'s own header so it is not silently shipped.
>
> **⭐ GAP I / THE 1613–2032 Hz REMAINDER — INVESTIGATED 2026-07-22, REFRAMED, AND `kInputRef[V1E]`
> RE-FIT 7.0 → 6.0 (SHIPPED). Four findings; read the last one before touching any V1E constant.**
> - **❌ `V1EEvenShaper` REFUTED as the cause — do not re-run this.** It was the obvious suspect (it
>   shipped 2026-07-21, AFTER the onset-floor characterisation, and is a broadband always-on
>   memoryless shaper — the class that manufactures a floor; CLAUDE.md's "V1E ships with its
>   saturator disabled ⇒ it can't be a bolt-on stage" argument has a hole, since the saturator is no
>   longer V1E's only memoryless stage). **Ablation moves THD by −0.000 pp.** The per-order control
>   is decisive and worth keeping: EVEN orders get **4.86 dB WORSE** without it while ODD move
>   **+0.004 dB** — so it is doing real work here, just not the work that makes the overshoot, and
>   its even-only-by-construction property is now verified empirically rather than assumed.
>   Tool: `analysis/v1e_mid_even_attribution.py`.
> - **✅ NOT a notch/denominator artefact.** Referenced to the 110 Hz control (⚠ the ABSOLUTE
>   fundamental comparison is an L-005 violation — NAM captures are level-normalized and it reads as
>   a fake uniform +5..+10 dB offset at every anchor, controls included), the plugin's fundamental is
>   **0.6–2.0 dB LOW** at driven levels ⇒ roughly **1–2 dB of the measured 6.8 dB ratio overshoot is
>   denominator**, the rest genuine harmonic generation. Tool: `analysis/v1e_onset_decompose.py`.
> - **⭐ IT IS AN ONSET-POSITION ERROR, NOT A SHAPE ERROR.** Signed per-order deltas: at **D1.00
>   (deep in clip) H3 +0.21, H5 +1.37 dB — odd orders essentially PERFECT** (evens deficient, H2 −9.4);
>   at **D0.50/−18 (onset) everything is too high** (H3 +6.8, H4 +9.4, H5 +9.1, H6 +15.3). Corroborated
>   from the FR side: −30 → −18 dBFS at D0.50 the plugin loses **3.6 dB** of fundamental relative to
>   the pedal ⇒ it compresses EARLIER. The model is right once both clip; the error is all at onset.
> - **⭐⭐ `kInputRef[V1E]` 7.0 → 6.0 SHIPPED — the 7.0 pin was STALE AND SINGLE-OBJECTIVE.** It came
>   from `v1e_pin_inref.py` on the D0.50 THD-vs-level SLOPE alone, on the 2026-07-18 chain, since when
>   V1E gained `V1EEvenShaper`, `HFEvenRestore`, the twin-T 1.05 rescale, the C12 47n restoration,
>   `DryTapDelay` and two polarity fixes — and **the doc's recorded slope ordering does not reproduce
>   on the current chain.** (L-005 applied to a fitted PARAMETER; the same staleness that caught V1L's
>   saturator the same day, and CLAUDE.md had already flagged that other constants of that era were
>   worth sweeping.) New JOINT fit over 6 metrics × 3 captures × 3 levels, notch-free anchors
>   (`analysis/v1e_inref_joint_refit.py`): THD magnitude **2.730 → 2.081 pp**, THD-vs-level slope

>   clean null **−17.00 → −17.26**; sole cost clean-sweep FR SHAPE **1.005 → 1.107 dB**.
>   - **⚠ A TRADE, NOT A DOMINANCE — AND THE TRADE IS THE REAL FINDING. `fr_clean` is a COMPRESSION
>     measure at D1.00 and is the ONLY metric wanting a hotter staging (it improved to the top of the
>     swept range, an edge non-result). So compression wants MORE clipping while every harmonic

>     **independently corroborates Gap I's "unfixable by any memoryless nonlinearity" verdict.**
>     6.0 is a documented JUDGEMENT CALL (guardrail #4); the alternative not ruled out is that
>     compression should outrank the harmonic metrics, in which case 7.0 or hotter is right.
>   - **`kV1eEvenA` needs NO re-fit** — an 8× sweep (0.005–0.04) moves every pooled metric by <0.2 at
>     any staging, so the coupling that would have forced a 2-D fit does not exist.
>   - **🆕 GATED AT LAST — `tests/V1EarlyInputRefTest` (33/33 green).** ⚠ **Before this, NOTHING in the
>     suite gated `kInputRef`**: every V1E test drives `V1EarlyDSP` in the VOLTS domain, where the

>     with the whole suite green — which is how 7.0 survived six chain changes unexamined. The gate
>     applies the staging itself (as `processBlock` does) and reads THD at **daw amp 0.125, where the
>     KNEE falls**: shipped 0.603 % vs stale-7.0 1.977 % (**10.3 dB separation**). Verified to FAIL at
>     7.0 as the SOLE failure (L-003, both ways). Window [0.30, 1.50] deliberately tolerates an honest
>     re-fit anywhere in 5.0–6.5 rather than freezing 6.0 to a precision the FINAL matrix cannot
>     deliver. ⚠ The 0.25/0.50 rows are printed to show why no other amplitude works — both stagings
>     are deep in clip there and read ~0 dB apart (Gap D Finding 2's saturation blindness).
>   - ⚠ **Stale-binary trap recurred here:** restoring `Calibration.h` from a `sed -i.bak` backup

> - **CONFIRMS, no new action:** the Gap-G notch complex (~370–1050 Hz, wider than the script's
>   strict ±1/6-oct guard — widen the mental model, not just the code, when reading THD near there)
>   carries the largest swings in BOTH directions, sign differing per revision (V1E overshoot
>   +6.6/+9.1 dB @806/1016 Hz; V2 deficient −17 dB @640/806 Hz) — consistent with each rev's own
>   notch-shoulder shape already flagged unarbitrable, not three independent clip defects.
>   **✅ RE-CHECKED 2026-07-21 (later session, queued punch-list item) — still holds, no action.**
>   `thd_band_audit.csv`'s 5 notch-flagged rows: V2 640 Hz −17.7 dB (deficient), V1E 640 Hz −9.8 dB
>   (deficient, smaller), V1E 403 Hz +8.8 dB (overshoot — same rev, opposite sign at a neighbouring
>   band), V1L 403/640 Hz both "good" grade (mild). Same pattern as originally logged; nothing new
>   to chase. Closing this off the punch list.
> - **CONFIRMS + sharpens, no new action:** the documented "~11 dB intrinsic HF shortfall" (Gap D)
>   at 6.4/8.1 kHz is present on **all three revisions**, not V2-alone as the existing writeup
>   emphasizes — V1E −8.6/−18.3 dB, V1L −8.5/−22.2 dB, V2 −15.9/−32.1 dB. V1E has no clip element at
>   all, so a shared-shape deficiency across all three argues this is a linear/recovery-stage HF
>   rolloff effect (H2 at 2f rolling off faster than the pedal's), not three independent per-rev
>   clip-element gaps. Still low-priority (tiny absolute energy, "midband before HF residual").
> - **CORROBORATES the in-progress WIP:** V2's 100–320 Hz THD overshoot (+3–4 dB) lines up exactly
>   with what the uncommitted `src/dsp/ClipHarmonicReducer.h` (shipping default OFF, not yet fit —
>   see its header) is being built to correct — independent evidence the fix targets the right band.
> - **❌ REFUTED 2026-07-21 (magnitude computed, no rendering needed — L-010) — the WetHFCorrection
>   hypothesis is DEAD, do not re-attempt it as the explanation.** V1L carries a large, CONTIGUOUS
>   THD overshoot across 1.6–5 kHz (+5 to +7 dB at 1613/2032/2560/3225/4064/5120 Hz; V2 shows a
>   smaller matching bump, +5.5 dB @4064 Hz). It was hypothesized that `WetHFCorrection`'s +3 dB/Q1.1
>   bell (3400 Hz, added 2026-07-21 to fix a *linear* FR deficiency in the same band) was boosting a
>   fundamental's own harmonics more than the fundamental, inflating THD as a side effect.
>   `analysis/wetbell_harmonic_gain_check.py` (new, capture-free — evaluates the shipped RBJ biquad's
>   EXACT digital magnitude response at each fundamental and its harmonics) computes the bell's own
>   predicted contribution: **+0.5, −0.4, −1.7, −2.7, −2.4, −1.4 dB** at those six anchors — an order
>   of magnitude too small, and mostly the WRONG SIGN (the bell would if anything COOL the THD at the
>   higher anchors, since the fundamental itself sits nearer the bell's peak than its harmonics do).
>   Measured deltas (+5 to +7 dB) are NOT explained by the bell. **⇒ the real cause is upstream of
>   this EQ** — genuine clip/harmonic-generation behaviour, not a side effect of the 2026-07-21
>   correction. ~~Needs its own investigation (not yet started); likely the same class of
>   drive-independent-memory issue as Gap D~~ — **INVESTIGATED 2026-07-22, AND IT IS NOT A
>   HARMONIC-GENERATION PROBLEM AT ALL. See the ✅ block immediately below; the "same class as Gap D"
>   guess was wrong and the "contiguous 1.6–5 kHz overshoot" framing is itself an artefact.**

> **✅ THE "V1L 1.6–5 kHz THD OVERSHOOT" IS A MISPLACED DRY/WET CANCELLATION NULL, NOT EXCESS

> - **THE PREMISE IS PARTLY A RATIO ARTEFACT** (`analysis/v1l_midhf_thd_premise_check.py`). The audit
>   ranks on `20·log10(plugin/pedal)`, which explodes when the denominator is tiny. Above ~4 kHz the
>   pedal's THD is a **fraction of a percent**, so +7 dB of ratio is **+0.76 pp** at 4064 Hz — and at
>   **5120 Hz the two metrics have OPPOSITE SIGNS** (mean_pp **−0.81**, i.e. the plugin is absolutely
>   COOLER, while mean_db reads **+4.82**). A band whose pp and dB disagree on direction is not one
>   coherent defect. Only **1613–3225 Hz** is a coherent overshoot (pp +1.3 to +4.8, 9/0 cells hot).
> - **⭐ AND IT IS ESSENTIALLY ONE CAPTURE.** The huge ratios are overwhelmingly **BL0.30**
>   (2032 Hz: BL1.00 +4.0/+0.8/−3.1 dB, BL0.65 +0.0/+0.8/+1.9, **BL0.30 +11.9/+14.6/+19.1**).
> - **⭐ THE MECHANISM: THD RISES AS YOU DILUTE WITH A CLEAN SIGNAL** — arithmetically impossible
>   unless the FUNDAMENTAL is vanishing (`analysis/v1l_thd_blend_dilution.py`, blend swept at FIXED
>   drive). At 5120 Hz plugin THD runs **1.75 → 1.92 → 2.43 → 4.72 → 6.57 %** across blend
>   1.00→0.30, then collapses to 0.19 % at 0.05 and **0.000 at blend 0** (so the wet path is the sole
>   harmonic source, exactly as the topology says — the dilution control PASSES).
> - **⭐ CONFIRMED BY MONOTONICITY, WITH CLEAN CONTROLS** (`analysis/v1l_hf_fundamental_null.py`).
>   The clean-sweep FUNDAMENTAL at 5120 Hz is **non-monotonic in blend** — falls to −12.20 dB at
>   blend 0.15 and **recovers to −7.85 at 0.10**, i.e. **4.34 dB below both endpoints**. A same-phase
>   sum can never dip and recover. All three control anchors (200/400/1000 Hz) stay monotonic ⇒ the
>   measurement is sound. **This is L-014's class again: a null is a PHASE defect.**
> - **⭐ SIZED AGAINST THE PEDAL: our null sits +0.27 OCTAVE TOO HIGH**
>   (`analysis/v1l_hf_notch_locate.py`, dense CSD grid — the band table's ~⅓-oct grid can only say
>   "different bin"). **BL0.30: pedal 4260 Hz vs plugin 5127 Hz.** BL1.00 and BL0.65 **AGREE**
>   (+0.06/+0.00 oct) — correct, because at high blend there is almost no dry leg to cancel against,
>   which is itself a consistency check on the whole story.
> - **⛔ NONE OF THE FOUR NAMED WET-PATH LAYERS PLACES IT** (`analysis/v1l_hf_notch_ablate.py`, each
>   flag verified LIVE per L-009). Shipped null 4898 Hz; ablating `WetHFCorrection` **+12 Hz**,
>   `WetTopOctaveRestore` −88, `HFEvenRestore` **+0**, `WetLFCorrection` +6 — all ≪ the ~800 Hz gap.
>   **⇒ the misplacement is in the CORE wet-path model, not the calibration layers.** Note
>   `WetHFCorrection` off makes the null **DEEPER** (−15.58 vs −8.76) — the bell partially FILLS the
>   null without moving it, which **extends its documented magnitude-only exoneration to PHASE**
>   (the refutation above was computed on magnitude alone, and the whole FR toolchain is phase-blind).
> - **⚠ THE ALREADY-CLOSED BLEND DISCREPANCY EXPLAINS ~44% OF IT, NOT ALL** (`--blend-sweep`). The
>   null frequency is a SECOND, independent observable that also depends on blend, so it can test the
>   previously **unfalsifiable** "pedal behaves like blend ≈0.19–0.21, not 0.30" lead. Rendering at
>   blend 0.20 moves our null 5127 → **4746 Hz**, closing 381 of the 867 Hz gap; **+486 Hz (~0.16 oct)
>   survives even at blend 0.15.** ⇒ the blend lead is corroborated as a real contributor but is
>   **not sufficient**; a genuine wet-path phase/corner error remains.
> - **⛔ IT IS THE MODELLED CIRCUIT, NOT NUMERICS (L-012, `analysis/v1l_hf_notch_os_invariance.py`).**
>   Oversampling must not change the modelled circuit, so sweeping it separates "ours" from "the
>   model". Null position across OS 1/2/4/8: **5238 / 5109 / 5156 / 5127 Hz — spread 129 Hz** (and
>   2/4/8 agree within 47 Hz), with the 200 Hz control flat to **0.01 dB**. ⇒ **NOT the Gap J class**
>   (there the null frequency tracked the latency, 359→320→285 Hz). There is no free timing fix.
> - **⛔ BOTH PHASE-ONLY FIXES ARE REFUTED ON A PAPER-TEST — NO C++ WRITTEN, DO NOT RE-ATTEMPT**
>   (`analysis/v1l_hf_notch_allpass_feasibility.py`; legs split exactly via `NALR_NODRY`,
>   reconstruction error **0.00e+00**, identity control reproduces the shipped null 5127 Hz / rms
>   2.19 dB exactly). An allpass looked structurally ideal — magnitude-neutral, so it **cannot**
>   disturb BL1.00/BL0.65 which already agree (guardrail #6 by physics). It does not work:
>   - **WET-leg allpass: DESTROYS the null instead of moving it.** At every corner 1.5-12 kHz and
>     order 1-2 there is **no interior dip left at all**, and broadband shape rms worsens **+0.45 to
>     +2.27 dB**. "Moved" and "filled" look identical to an argmin — they are not the same outcome.
>   - **DRY-leg allpass: places the FREQUENCY perfectly and gets the DEPTH badly wrong.** order=1
>     fc=12000 lands the null at **4283 Hz vs the pedal's 4260 (+0.01 oct)** — but **15.3 dB deep
>     against the pedal's 3.6 dB**, and shape still worsens (+0.35 dB). ⚠ That config is
>     algebraically `a=0`, i.e. **a pure ONE-SAMPLE dry delay** — a suspicious coincidence worth
>     remembering, but the depth blow-up and the shape regression both argue it is NOT a latent
>     alignment bug (a real alignment fix would improve broadband shape, not worsen it).
> - **⚠ THE FEATURE IS SMALLER THAN THE EARLY NUMBERS SUGGESTED.** Measured as PROMINENCE (a local
>   dip on a falling curve) rather than depth-vs-window-shoulders, the pedal's null is **3.6 dB** and
>   ours **2.4 dB**. The defect is a ~⅓-octave misplacement of a **~3 dB** dip, on ONE capture.
>   ⚠ **METHOD NOTE, cost two runs:** a plain `argmin` cannot locate this null — the wet path rolls
>   off steeply above ~9 kHz, so the global minimum over any adequate window sits at the top EDGE,
>   and WIDENING the window (the standard fix for an edge-optimum) made it strictly worse until even
>   the identity control reported the edge. **Use `find_peaks` prominence for a dip on a slope.**
> - **⇒ DISPOSITION: OPEN, best-effort, NOT worth a correction on current evidence.** Every
>   structurally-safe instrument is refuted by measurement; what remains is a blend-gated MAGNITUDE
>   EQ fitted to the single capture that shows the null, with no capture-free arbiter and no
>   cross-validation possible — the guardrail #6 failure mode, for a ~3 dB narrow-band prize.
>   **Recommend leaving the ~4–6 kHz null and documenting.** The remaining target for THAT piece is
>   narrow and specific: **what sets the wet leg's phase at 4–5 kHz** (the S-K cab-sim cascade corners
>   and any residual dry/wet timing — note Gap J was itself a dry-tap alignment bug). **Do NOT fit an
>   EQ against the 4–5 kHz THD numbers** — above ~4 kHz they are a ratio artefact over a sub-percent
>   pedal THD.
>   ⚠ **Any future work here MUST use a complex transfer** — `analyze.transfer()` takes `np.abs`, so
>   the standard toolchain cannot see the quantity that is actually wrong.

>   - **⚠ DELIBERATELY NOT THE GRID'S BEST TOTAL** (0.30/1.20 scored 2.284 vs the shipped 2.322).

> **V1L consistently carries ~45-52° MORE phase lead at 25-63 Hz**, tapering out by 100 Hz — the
> fingerprint of one extra single-pole HP in the cascade. There is exactly one confirmed,
> V1L-EXCLUSIVE candidate: **the wet make-up buffer's C10(10n)/R14(100k), a 159 Hz corner neither
> V1E nor V2 has an equivalent of** (V1E has no such buffer stage at all; V2's nearest analog, C41/R46,
> sits at a gentler, now-restored 72 Hz). DRIVE module coupling caps (C28/C8) and the twin-T were
> both empirically ruled out first (bypass tests / shared-class comparison against the now-clean V1E).
>
> **The destructive-interference mechanism.** V1L's BLEND pot is a real potentiometer (not an ideal
> crossfade): at BLEND=100% the dry leg still carries the FULL 100 kΩ (a real pot's "off" leg is
> never infinite), competing against the wet leg's C12 (47 nF) reactance, which is comparable
> magnitude at ~34 Hz. That's schematically faithful and shared by V2 too (same topology, minimal
> effect: leak contribution only ~1.0-1.4 dB). On V1L the SAME mechanism produces a **-12.6 dB**
> leak contribution (10x bigger) purely because the wet signal arrives ~50° out of phase with the
> (zero-phase, direct-wire) dry signal — destructive interference needs phase misalignment, not just
> comparable impedance, and V1L has it, V1E/V2 don't.
>
> **THREE CORRECTION SHAPES TRIED, applied to the WET signal only, before BLEND:**
> 1. **Flat 2nd-order RBJ low-shelf** (ToneWarpShelf's usual pattern) — REJECTED. Needed +12 dB to hit
>    the isolated peak target, and at that magnitude completely DOMINATED the downstream BASS/TREBLE
>    peaking stage: the peak locked to ONE frequency regardless of drive/bass/treble knob position —
>    it broke the tone controls' own knob-responsiveness, a worse defect than the one being fixed.
> 2. **Pole-zero magnitude filter** (cancel C10's 159 Hz zero analytically, reintroduce a lower pole —
>    i.e. exactly what "C10 were larger" would do, without touching the schematic value, guardrail #1
>    compliant) — REJECTED. Converged BEAUTIFULLY in isolation (peak 100→70.3 Hz, edge -19.7→-10.4 dB,
>    both §1 targets hit simultaneously) — but FAILED `V1LateIntegrationTest`'s existing §1 gate at the
>    REAL reference condition (dry leg genuinely present, not isolated): baseline LF edge was already
>    fine (-9.7 dB, close to §1's -10), the correction made it much WORSE (-19.9 dB). **Root cause:
>    destructive interference is a PHASE problem — boosting the wet path's MAGNITUDE just feeds more
>    amplitude into the still-misaligned phase sum, deepening the very null it was meant to fix.**
>    This is now **L-014** (see Lessons). Methodological lesson for future tuning: an isolated
>    (dry-forced-to-zero) test condition is NOT the same thing as rendering at the reference knob
>    settings through the REAL signal path — always validate against the latter, which is what the
>    project's own existing gates already do.
> 3. **1st-order allpass** (unity magnitude, phase-only) tuned to cancel the ~50° excess — WORKS
>    DIRECTIONALLY, NEVER REGRESSES, but has an unresolved drive-dependence (see below). Isolated:
>    null(25-63Hz re peak) -24.4→-8.4 dB, peak 125→80 Hz — **both improve together from a
>    magnitude-neutral fix**, strong evidence the interference was inflating the apparent peak error,
>    not a separate defect. Passes `V1LateIntegrationTest`'s §1 gate (unlike attempt 2) — low bump
>    moved -1.7→+5.7 dB (target ~+0.5, PASS), LF edge -9.7→-6.4 to -19.9 dB depending on corner tested
>    (fc=50 for the magnitude test, fc=15 for the phase test — DIFFERENT numbers, don't conflate the

> - **V2 HF ~2–4 kHz is ~3 dB LOW.** ✅ **DONE 2026-07-21 — and it was a SHARED V1L+V2 deficit, not
  V2-only.** Investigating all three revs (user ask) found V1E already correct at 2–4 kHz (±0.2 dB
  clean) but BOTH V1L and V2 consistently ~2.5–3.5 dB dark across ~1.6–5 kHz, centred ~3.5 kHz,
  LINEAR (on the clean sweep) and KNOB-INDEPENDENT (constant across treble 0.30→0.75, drive
  0.25→0.90, presence 0.30→0.75 — a fixed wet-path property, not under-delivered TREBLE/PRESENCE).
  ⚠ **Capture-vs-SPICE, closed by MATCHING THE CAPTURES per explicit user instruction.** At the §1
  condition the MODEL already matches the author's SPICE high-bump (`analysis/hf_s1_check.py`: V1E
  +1.99@3150 vs §1 +1.5; V2 −8.80@2806 vs §1 −10, model even ~1 dB brighter), so the NAM captures
  carry ~3 dB MORE 3–4 kHz than SPICE itself — the ⚖ rule would normally leave it best-effort. The
  user steered to match the captures ("get the top end right") and pre-authorised a small EQ, so the
  fix is a wet-path **peaking bell** `src/dsp/WetHFCorrection.h` (3400 Hz/+3 dB/Q1.1, wet path before
  BLEND, ON V1L+V2, OFF V1E — mirrors WetLFCorrection), documented in-code as a DELIBERATE departure
  from §1 (guardrail #4). Results (SHAPE, gap_audit): V2 3225/4064 Hz driven −3.29/−3.53 (both HUGE)
  → −0.62/−1.19; V1L clean 2560/3225/4064 −3.14/−3.25/−2.49 → −1.52/−0.72/−0.09. Pooled target-band
  (1.5–6 kHz) RMS V1L 3.77→2.39, V2 3.30→1.59; guard band flat/improving; V1E bit-identical. Gated by
  the wet-HF boost-delta check in V1Late/V2 IntegrationTest (ablate `NALR_WETHF_OFF` ⇒ FAILS; boost
  11.13/11.83 active vs 8.37/9.08 ablated). New diagnostics: `analysis/hf_s1_check.py`,
  `analysis/wet_hf_verify.py`. 30/30 green.

> - **V1E twin-T NOTCH center — ✅ DONE 2026-07-21. THE "~630 Hz" PREMISE WAS REFUTED; the real
>   defect was a ~35 Hz composite shift, now corrected per-rev.** Measured (`analysis/notch_center_
>   measure.py`, argmin of the clean-sweep transfer, all 11 captures): **every PEDAL notch centre is
>   674-762 Hz, mean 721** — there is NO 630 Hz notch on any rev. The "630" read off the dashboard was
>   the notch's LEFT SHOULDER (pedal already −17 dB there; V1E/V1L's ~430 Hz bridged-T stretches the
>   left side, pulling the VISUAL centre down). **V2's notch is ~715 Hz, not 630** (verified per the
>   user's ask). The genuine error: V1e's plugin COMPOSITE notch sat ~35 Hz HIGH (argmin 750 vs pedal
>   715; 800-900 Hz top shoulder 3-4 dB too deep), while V1L/V2 already matched their captures. Fixed
>   by scaling V1e's three twin-T caps ~5% (`kV1eNotchFreqScale = 1.05` in V1EarlyStages.h → the shared
>   `TwinTNotch(notchFreqScale)` ctor; C26 output-coupling UNSCALED). Composite V1e notch 750→714.7
>   (dead-on 714.7 capture); whole scoop 400-1000 Hz now overlays the pedal to a few tenths. V1L/V2
>   bit-identical (they keep scale 1.0). Gated by V1EarlyPresenceTest's absolute calibrated-centre
>   window [655,705] Hz (excludes schematic ~716; **verified to FAIL on revert to 1.0**, guardrail #3).
>   The analytic reference in that test tracks the same scale so the WDF-vs-analytic discretisation
>   check stays valid. **This is a deliberate, documented per-rev departure from schematic (guardrails
>   #1/#4/#6) — NOT a mistranscription; the twin-T is genuinely identical on the schematic, the

> 3. **Gap D V2 half** (main Gap-D block above). The single biggest audible defect left (10+ dB THD

>    **−0.90/−0.41/−0.10/+0.11/+0.06/−0.06/+0.22 dB** (was −3.13.. −2.26) — the plugin MATCHES the pedal
>    to ±0.5 dB across 1.3–4 kHz and runs POSITIVE at 5–6.5 kHz. The only real FR error in that region
>    is a **narrow twin-T NOTCH misplacement** (plugin notch min ~756 Hz vs pedal ~673 Hz — a +3.3 dB
>    shoulder @673 then a −6.4 dB dip @756), which is the SEPARATE queued "V1E notch 800→630 Hz" tweak,

> 6. **Gap D's ~11 dB intrinsic HF shortfall** (item 3, "▶ NEXT STEPS"). ✅ UNBLOCKED 2026-07-20 —

> - **⛔ THE BL1.00 CAPTURE ASKS FOR ~+34 dB AND MUST NOT BE BELIEVED. Do NOT re-tune this against it.**
>   Three independent reasons, all measured this session: (1) our wet path is **−41.6 dB @12.5 kHz** re
>   1 kHz and **SPICE §1 puts V1L's wet path at −40 dB by ~11 kHz** — the model already matches its only
>   capture-free reference; the capture demands −7.9 dB, i.e. the two cascaded S-K cab-sim stages barely
>   roll off at all. (2) **THE PEDAL'S OWN TOP OCTAVE IS NON-MONOTONIC IN BLEND** (12.5 kHz: −7.89 at
>   BL1.00, −26.38 at BL0.65, −7.75 at BL0.30) — adding a FLAT dry leg to a DARK wet leg cannot REDUCE
>   the top octave by 18 dB, so at least one of those three captures is untrustworthy in this band.
>   That is a **capture-intrinsic** disqualification (plugin never involved — the L-007 standard).
>   (3) the captures **disagree about the sign**: at BLEND<1.00 the plugin is already TOO BRIGHT up here
>   (+6.4 dB at BL0.65, +4.4 at BL0.90, +4.2 at BL0.95).
> - **⭐ THE LEG SPLIT IS THE KEY NEW MEASUREMENT** (`analysis/gaph_topoct_legs.py`, NALR_NODRY,
>   reconstruction err ~1e-15). Who owns the top octave at 12.5 kHz, re the full render at 1 kHz:
>   **BL1.00 wet −41.6 / dry −74.2** (dry leak 32.6 dB DOWN ⇒ the band is **100% wet path**);
>   BL0.65 wet −39.5 / dry −20.6 (dry dominates by 18.9); BL0.30 wet −41.4 / dry −9.4 (by 32.0).
>   `sum − max(leg)` ≈ 0.1–0.6 dB at BL1.00 ⇒ **NO cancellation, so L-014's "diagnose a null with
>   phase" does NOT apply** — checked FIRST and refuted, which is exactly what L-014 demands.
> - **⇒ THE WET-PATH INSERTION POINT SATISFIES GUARDRAIL #6 BY PHYSICS, NOT BY FITTING.** Being
>   pre-BLEND, the shelf's audible effect is diluted exactly as the dry leg takes over. **MEASURED**
>   (`analysis/wet_top_verify.py`, ON minus NALR_WETTOP_OFF): at 12.5 kHz **BL1.00 +4.57 | BL0.65 +0.74
>   | BL0.30 +0.17**; at 16 kHz +5.29 / +0.12 / +0.02. ~6:1 at 12.5k and ~44:1 at 16k, with the 1 kHz
>   control inert (0.03 dB). ONE fixed filter, no knob tracking.
> - **✅ AND A SMALL PART OF IT HAS CAPTURE-FREE SUPPORT.** The §1 **−40 dB point moves 10.82 → 11.04 kHz**
>   against §1's ~11 kHz target — essentially exact. It does not break the §1 anchor; it improves it.
>   ⚠ The ablated BASELINE is **10.82 kHz, measured** — NOT the 10.08 the docs quote for the R48/R49=22k
>   fix (that predates WetHFCorrection and the other layers, which already moved it). An earlier draft
>   of this entry cited 10.08 from the docs instead of measuring the ablated build, and the first
>   9 kHz/Q0.7 shelf then read 11.61 — an apparent "improvement" that was partly an overshoot past §1's
>   target measured against a stale baseline. **Measure the ablated build; do not quote a historical
>   number as the baseline** (sibling of L-005).
> - **⭐ THE CORNER/Q ARE MEASURED, NOT EAR-TUNED — the null caught real collateral damage.**
>   `analysis/wet_top_null_sweep.py` (null depth vs shelf gain, boundary-guarded). A first pass at
>   **9000 Hz / Q0.7** cost **BL0.30 sweep_clean −11.40 → −10.18 dB** — far too large to be the top
>   octave, which is only 1.46% of that capture's sweep energy. Cause: at **BL0.30 / 4 kHz the legs sit
>   at −150° with the SUM 5.79 dB BELOW the louder leg** (a near-cancellation, where a small change in
>   one leg is AMPLIFIED in the sum), and a Q0.7 shelf still delivers ~+1.5 dB an octave below its
>   corner, so its skirt landed in that zone. **13000 Hz / Q0.9 keeps it out**: null penalty at
>   BLEND=1.00 and 0.65 is **ZERO at every gain to +12 dB**, BL0.30's halves. Do not lower the corner
>   or Q without re-running that sweep.
> - **⛔ THE NULL CANNOT ARBITRATE THE LIFT ITSELF — IT HAS NO POWER HERE, AND THIS REFUTES A
>   DOCUMENTED CLAIM.** The pedal's energy **above 9 kHz is 0.11% of the clean sweep at BL1.00**
>   (0.01% at BL0.65, 1.46% at BL0.30), so even a PERFECT top-octave fix moves the BL1.00 null by
>   **~0.015 dB** — below the metric's own noise. Measured: −5.10 (off) → −5.08 (+6 dB) → −4.93
>   (+18 dB), i.e. flat then very slightly worse. ⇒ **the earlier note that BL1.00's null "is dominated
>   by the parked Gap H err2 top-octave item" is WRONG** — 0.11% of the energy cannot dominate a −5 dB
>   null. Whatever limits BL1.00's null (−5.1, vs BL0.65 −10.6 and BL0.30 −11.4) lives where the energy
>   is, i.e. the midband/LF, and is **an open lead nobody has chased**. ⚠ Also beware BL0.65's reported
>   "interior optimum at 6 dB": it is an AVERAGING ARTEFACT — `sweep_clean` improves monotonically while
>   `sweep_drv_-12` worsens monotonically and they cancel. Read the per-segment columns, not the mean.
> - **PHYSICAL-CAUSE HUNT CAME BACK EMPTY (guardrail #2), which is why this is artificial:** blend
>   off-side leak is FAITHFUL (physics gives ~−51 dB through the 100k pot against C12's 271 Ω at
>   12.5 kHz; the model measures within ~2 dB); no cancellation (above); discretisation already handled
>   (`topoct_analog_truth.py`, ~1.7 dB at 16 kHz); S-K stopband floor-out can only DARKEN (wrong sign,
>   `v1l_sk_stopband_floor.py`); PRESENCE/C42/S-K corner ruled out on authority long ago.
>   **The alternative NOT ruled out (guardrail #4): the model is simply RIGHT and the pedal is this dark**
>   — unsettleable, the matrix is FINAL and §1 has no curve above ~12.5 kHz. `kWetTopDb = 0.0` ships it off.
> - **✅ V2 CHECKED AND LEFT OFF (`kWetTopDbV2 = 0.0`, V2 bit-identical) — and the check produced a NEW
>   METHODOLOGICAL LESSON.** The layer IS wired into `V2DSP` (same shape, own gain constant) so it is
>   measurable, and enabling it does NO measurable harm (worst null change across V2's 5 captures is
>   +0.03 dB). It was still left off, because the only numeric evidence favouring it fails its own
>   power check: **V2's energy above 9 kHz is 0.00% of the clean sweep on ALL FIVE captures** ⇒ the max
>   null change ANY top-octave fix can produce is ~0.000 dB. Yet the sweep showed the null improving
>   monotonically (pooled −0.037 dB at +12) and, widened, a **"pooled INTERIOR optimum at 18 dB"**.
>   Both are spurious — the observed 0.08 dB swing EXCEEDS what the lift can explain, so it is the
>   shelf's **SKIRT below 9 kHz**, not the lift. ⇒ **V2 is an EAR decision, exactly as V1L was.**
> - **⭐ NEW LESSON (automated into `wet_top_null_sweep.py`): THE BOUNDARY GUARD IS NOT ENOUGH.** This
>   project already learned that an optimum on the EDGE of a sweep is a non-result (Vzt 0.20–0.60;
>   `v1l_blend_knob_probe`). V2 adds the other half: **an INTERIOR optimum is equally worthless when
>   the metric has no POWER in the band being changed.** Bound the metric's power FIRST (here: the
>   band's share of the reference energy), and treat any swing LARGER than that bound as evidence the
>   knob is moving something OTHER than the thing you think you are tuning. The script now prints the
>   bound per capture and flags both failure modes.
> - **⚠ THE "V1L-SPECIFIC" FRAMING WAS STALE.** Re-measured (`analysis/gaph_topoct_current.py`, reads
>   the existing JSON, no renders): **V1E is now CLEAN up there** (top-octave shape mean **+0.02 dB**
>   across its 3 captures) but **V2 is NOT** (mean **−2.73**; its three BL1.00 captures read −9.9/−6.5/−5.8
>   and its BL0.90/0.95 read +4.4/+4.2 — the SAME blend-organised sign structure). **V2 is deliberately
>   NOT enabled** — that is a separate ear decision, not a numeric one. V1L's own numbers are unchanged
>   from 2026-07-17 (−24.00/+6.14/−2.00 vs the documented −25.3/+6.2/−1.9), so the deficit is NOT stale.
> - Gated by the top-octave boost-delta check in `V1LateIntegrationTest` (g@14k − g@1050): **shipped

>   `NALR_WETTOP_OFF` as the SOLE failure (L-003). ⚠ The first draft used a **5 kHz** reference and had
>   almost no separation (2.5 dB) — a Q0.7 shelf cornered at 9 kHz still delivers ~+1.5 dB an octave

>    Softer knee increases low-drive THD without fixing the 400Hz deficit. Vzt=0.30 matches 400Hz
>    better but blows up 100/200Hz. Gap D is NOT in the knee parameters.
> 2. **V2 Cj re-verification** — Cj=10 pF still best (RMS 3.507 dB vs 3.492 at 4.7 pF).
> 3. **V1E end-R re-check** — Tested Rend=0.5Ω with T-001 GBW active. THD improved (100Hz: 4.5→7.9%,
>    200Hz: 8.8→16.5%) but FR regressed (D1.00 rms 9.50→16.03 dB) and knob-tracking all-positive
>    (+9.6 dB max). Reverted to 8kΩ — it compensates for effects beyond GBW (likely large-signal
>    output impedance or recovery-saturator interaction).
> 4. **V1L recovery saturator (gap F) — FITTED (2026-07-17).** V1L had NO recovery saturator
>    (gain=0). sat_refine.py --rev V1L found gain=0.400/knee=0.500/offset=0.100 → RMS 11.1 dB
>    vs 102.1 disabled (9× improvement). Applied to V1LateDSP.h prepare(). THD improved at all
>    anchors (100Hz 9.8→14.7% vs pedal 12.1%; 800Hz 0.1→2.9% vs 50.2%). FR RMS improved
>    8.31→7.98 dB. Blend residual shrank slightly (LF +5.9→+5.3, cab-sim +9.4→+8.7).
> 5. **V2 saturator re-verification** — sat_refine.py --rev V2: current (0.04, 0.150, 0.080)
>    already at best (RMS 7.6). No change. V2's zener dominates THD; saturator is negligible.
> 6. **V1E saturator post-GBW** — (0.40, 0.25, 0.020) still optimal at D0.50. No change.
> 7. **Gap C (V2 bilinear warp) — CLOSED at OS=8x, but ⚠ RE-CHECK ITS EVIDENCE.** The OS=1x-artifact

>   Every confounded knob stays confounded. Where two gaps are entangled (J vs E), say so and treat
>   them as one item rather than pretending they can be separated.
> - **THD's ceiling is permanently 9.5 kHz** (Farina needs `N*f <= SWEEP_F1`=20 kHz). 9.5–12 kHz would
>   need a 24 kHz sweep ⇒ a re-capture ⇒ **impossible**. Above 12 kHz THD does not exist at 48 kHz.
>   **Do not re-raise "extend THD coverage".**
> - **Permanent blind spots, by matrix design — do not re-discover these:** V1E has **no BLEND<1.00
>   capture at all**; V2's are all **≥0.90**; V2 **BLEND=0.50 has none** (its only file was quarantined,
>   ISS-011); only V1L sweeps blend (1.00/0.65/0.30), and its three files move DRIVE and BASS at the
>   same time. There are exactly **two blend-matched pairs** in the whole matrix (V1L 0.30-vs-0.65,
>   V2 0.90-vs-1.00) and both already PASS (`capture_outlier_scan.py`).

> Its compression already matches the pedal to 0.25 dB, so there is no compression lever left; a
> drive normaliser is REFUTED for it (it breaks the compression: −0.25 → +2.48 dB) and must not be

> **(b) V1L polish, low value.** `makeup` is now fitted and validated; only `tau`/`scHz` were never

> trade (closing it costs +5.35 dB at D0.40). Do not reopen without a reason.
> **(c) ⚠ When using `gapd_fit_harness.py`, read the PER-AXIS columns for any per-revision decision.**
> Its "best JOINT" headline pools both axes with the layer ENABLED ON V2, which is not the shipping
> configuration — that is how it recommended a `makeup` that loses on V1L's own metric.

>   `dGain = gain(−6) − gain(−18)` (0 = linear, −12 = hard clamp).
> - **THE CLIP DEPTH MATCHES EVERYWHERE IT CAN BE MEASURED.** `dGain` delta at D0.90 is **zero
>   (±0.7 dB) at every frequency except 620/800 Hz (+5.5/+6.0)** — because everywhere else BOTH are

>   threshold ⇒ the only band with measuring power, and there **the pedal's clip node is ~6 dB hotter
>   than ours**. (Durable trick: to measure clip-node drive on a clamping chain, read it IN a notch.)
> - **At D0.50 (control PASSES) the deficit is broad: ~0 below 310 Hz, +2 to +3.5 dB from 440 Hz up.**
>   ⇒ our clip node is **2–6 dB too cold from ~440 Hz up, correct at LF** — a PRE-DRIVE shaping

> |---|---|---|
> | **H err2** | V1L top octave ~19 dB too dark (capture-only) | ✅ **CLOSED 2026-07-22 — final.** Fixed 2026-07-21 by `WetTopOctaveRestore.h` (V1L-only wet-path high shelf 13 kHz/+6 dB/Q0.9, gain EAR-TUNED). The leg split proved the band is 100% WET path at BL1.00 (dry leak 32.6 dB down, no cancellation) and the wet insertion point gives ~6:1 blend dilution for free (guardrail #6 by physics). ⛔ The BL1.00 capture's implied ~+34 dB is REJECTED — the pedal's own top octave is NON-MONOTONIC in blend, and the model already matches §1. §1's −40 dB point IMPROVES (10.82 → 11.04 kHz vs target ~11). Gated (fails on `NALR_WETTOP_OFF`). **2026-07-22: user accepted the shipped +6 dB/13 kHz/Q0.9 as final — the prepared `wet_top_audition.py` A/B listening pass was NOT run. Do not re-open the magnitude without a new reason.** V2 stays OFF (`kWetTopDbV2 = 0.0`) — same ear-decision status, deliberately not revisited. Prior state: ✅ **CLOSED best-effort 2026-07-19 by the ⚖ ARBITRATION RULE** — it is a LINEAR quantity, the model already satisfies the schematic AND §1, and only the NAM capture disagrees ⇒ SPICE wins, disagreement flagged, no retune. |
> | **C** | V2 12.5k/16k HF | ✅ **CLOSED best-effort 2026-07-18.** Re-derived on SHAPE (`v2_gapc_shape_os.py`): "recovery-cascade warp" framing was WRONG; <12k matched, 16k/18k = OS droop already handled. Real correctable part = base-rate **tone-stack swept-cap warp** (V1L/V2 −3/−3.7 dB @16k, V1E ~0). Prewarp tried → **reverted** (0.02 dB; swept caps, dsp.md forbids). Fixed by `src/dsp/ToneWarpShelf.h` calibration high-shelf (V1L/V2, tuned to analog-truth not captures, SR-scaled, gated `ToneWarpShelfTest`). Model warp −3.68→−0.36 vs truth. Residual 14.5/16k = capture noise (unarbitrable). |
> | **J + E** | V1L 285 Hz phase notch **+** V2 BASS hump | ✅ **BOTH CLOSED 2026-07-19 — they were ONE defect, and it was ours.** J was an **oversampler-latency comb**: the dry tap was never delay-aligned with the oversampled wet path, so dry+wet summed misaligned by ~84 samples at 8x ⇒ first comb null at fs/(2·84) ≈ **285 Hz**. Fixed by `src/dsp/DryTapDelay.h` (no fitted constant — reads the oversampler's own latency; exact no-op at OS=1), gated by `DryTapAlignmentTest` (ablated: fails by 5.34/30.80/23.42 dB vs a 1.0 dB tol). **E then dissolved**: its BASS=0.50/0.35 captures ARE the only two V2 files with BLEND<1.00, so E's "~3 dB hump" was J's comb — after the fix those rows are the CLEANEST (+0.54/+0.64 dB) and the premise is inverted. Residual is a broad TILT uncorrelated with BASS or MID-SHIFT ⇒ ordinary V2 broadband residual, **not** a MID-stage error. See gap-audit §J/§E. |
> | **B** | Drive-dependent band saturation (800 Hz fill, 3–4k) | 🔄 **DEMOTED 2026-07-19 — the saturator is NOT V1L's main THD error, and the planned fix is REFUTED.** The joint LF+HF score §5 asked for was built (`v1l_sat_joint_score.py`) and it killed the fix it was built to gate: the error is **NON-MONOTONIC in frequency** (2k **+4.6/+0.2/+5.3**, 4k **+1.1/+2.2/+1.9** too HOT, but 8k **−6.2/−0.1/−0.6** too COLD), so **no band-limit/pre-emphasis can work** — a lowpass on the nonlinear drive cuts 2k, 4k AND 8k, and 8k needs MORE. **Do not implement it.** Saturator is a net JOINT win (rms **3.81 shipped vs 4.88 disabled**) ⇒ **KEEP, unchanged**; but Gap F's "9×" was an LF-only score, worth ~22% on a joint one. ⭐ **The real V1L THD error is 440 Hz** (see Gap D row). Prior state: V1L half root-caused to the Gap F saturator (`v1l_sat_hf_ablate.py`), 2.9 of 3.19 pp of 4 kHz THD. V1E/V2 3–4 kHz remnant is separate (V2 ~+3 dB vs §1). |

Required asymmetry is **0.05 V at D0.50/0.60 but 0.60 V at D1.00 (12×)** ⇒ **guardrail #6 FAILS, do not ship a fixed OR drive-dependent asymmetry.** The mechanism is wrong in KIND: a real rail asymmetry is a fixed voltage, and the only drive-dependent candidate (CMOS output Ron) lacks authority — the stage drives 330k, so output current is ~µA (L-010). Shipped −4.10 STAYS (best single value, plausible magnitude). ⚠ **A SECOND L-009 DEFECT WAS FOUND AND FIXED HERE** — `--rail-vneg/--rail-vpos` treated ±4.2 as "unspecified", so the symmetric baseline silently rendered V1E's −4.10 default; every scan grid containing −4.2 duplicated the −4.10 column, incl. the fit that chose the shipped value. Now NaN-sentinel, verified per revision. Prior state: **UNWOUND 2026-07-18** — the level/taper half is FIXED & SHIPPED: `kInputRef` now PER-REV (V1E **7.0**, V1L/V2 1.3), `kDriveEndR=0`, V1E saturator OFF. V1E D1.00 THD 4.7/4.4/7.0→**9.9/10.3/11.0** (vs pedal 10.4/9.8/8.4), FR held 1.79→1.71. Done capture-only (external anchor confirmed gone). **H2 RESTORED** via a 0.10 V asymmetric rail (−4.10/+4.20): harmonic median 48.8→**6.5** (better than pre-unwind 12.0). Residual: onset floor + drive-dependent H2 spread (best-effort). See gap-audit §I. |
> | **D-v1e** | V1E even harmonics (H2/H4/H6) −10..−40 dB LOW whole-band, all levels | ✅ **FIXED 2026-07-21**, found via a NEW granular per-order harmonic map (`analysis/gapd_harmonic_map.py`/`gapd_harmonic_perband.py`) built to broaden Gap-D work across all 3 revs. Was the LARGEST clean harmonic-magnitude error in the whole 11-capture matrix — bigger than V2's own "Gap D" residual once the notch (Gap G) is fenced off. Cause: pedal's H2 is a level-flat op-amp/VCOM-asymmetry FLOOR present BELOW the clip; the shipped asym rail only makes evens AT the clip. Fixed by `src/dsp/V1EEvenShaper.h` (even-only `y=x+a·x·tanh(x/k)`, wet path, zero odd-harmonic contamination by construction). Fit a=0.01/k=1.2: pooled \|H2Δ\| 18.0→8.9 dB, \|H3Δ\|/FR **unchanged**.

> 7.0 @14.5k, 6.4 @16.3k, **11.0 @18.2k**.
>
> - **Gap M — the THD ESTIMATOR was broken above 2.7 kHz; FIXED at source (L-006).** A spurious
>   Farina edge spike at `SWEEP_F1/N` fabricated "plugin 14.0% vs pedal 2.4% @2874 Hz" (48.1% at

> - **THD coverage is now 20 Hz–9.5 kHz** (was 3 kHz; bands with no data 14→6). **"THD to 18 kHz" is
>   not achievable and never was:** Farina needs `N*f <= SWEEP_F1` so H2 dies at 9.5 kHz, and above

>   sweeping to 24 kHz ⇒ **re-capturing the pedal**. Don't accept the 18 kHz framing for THD.
> - **Gap I (NEW) — THD-vs-LEVEL is wrong, and it SURVIVES Gap G.** G kills THD-vs-*frequency*;
>   varying LEVEL at a clean 101 Hz anchor is immune (the notch cuts the fundamental equally at every
>   level). V1E's plugin is level-FLAT — **3.1→5.3→5.3%** at −18/−12/−6 dBFS where the pedal goes

>   (zener clamping) while the plugin climbs. **This is the gate L-003 demanded, and it never existed.**
> - **Gap J (NEW) — V1L 285 Hz notch, monotonic in BLEND** (+1.5 / −2.5 / **−23.8 dB** at BL
>   1.00/0.65/0.30). Narrow + deep + dry-dependent ⇒ dry/wet **PHASE** cancellation, not a scalar.
>   **NOT the voided "phase-cancel" note** (that died with the quarantined V2 `_2` file; this is V1L,
>   three good captures, monotonic in the knob). Confounded with Gap E — a BLEND-only pair settles both.
> - **Harmonic MAGNITUDES are badly off:** median |plugin−pedal| over H2..H7, **notch-confounded
>   400/800 Hz anchors excluded** (Gap G) = **V1E 12.0 | V1L 9.2 | V2 5.7 dB**. Worst single reading:
>   V1E D0.50 **H2 +21.8 dB @100 Hz** — the same fault Gap I sees, in the harmonics instead of the

>
> ### Gap I — ROOT CAUSE FOUND, FIX DEFERRED BY DECISION (2026-07-17)
>
> **DECIDED: `kInputRef` stays 1.3; the V1E saturator stays as-is. The V1E-vs-V2 disagreement is
> deferred.** Do NOT fix Gap I piecemeal — read `phase10-gap-audit.md` section I first; every
> candidate fix is entangled. Summary of what was established:
> - **Three `OfflineRender` flags were SILENT NO-OPS** (fixed, 95f2264). `--sat-gain 0` could not
>   disable the saturator ⇒ **every V1E saturator-off experiment ever run measured it at full
>   strength**. See **L-009**.
> - With the saturator **genuinely** off, V1E D0.50 makes **0.00% THD at all three levels** — the
>   chain has no other distortion source; the saturator does 100% of the work.
> - **A tanh structurally cannot make the pedal's onset** (36-point scan; best slope err 3.54 dB at
>   15 dB abs cost). The pedal rises **+20.6 dB per +6 dB** of level; a tanh is analytic at 0 so its
>   small-signal THD grows as x² = **+12 dB per +6 dB and never faster**. The pedal has a THRESHOLD.
> - **The model's V1E drive range is ~one knob-turn short:** model @ **D=1.00** (0.00/5.20/8.27)
>   ≈ pedal @ **D=0.50** (0.42/4.49/7.03); the pedal's own D1.00 (10.4/9.8/8.5) is unreachable.
> - **It is a 4-deep COMPENSATOR STACK** — `kInputRef` 3.27→0.87 (*a different pedal's constant*) ⇒
>   under-clipping ⇒ P6's "+8 dB FR excess" (really **the pedal compressing**, per this file's own
>   measurement trap) ⇒ `kDriveEndR`=8k deleting **10.5 dB of real gain** ⇒ saturator 0.40/0.25 to
>   fake it back ⇒ Gap I. See **L-008**.
> - **BLOCKER:** saturator OFF, V1E wants `kInputRef` **≈5–6.5**, V2 wants **1.3** (and worsens
>   above it) — **13 dB apart on a global constant**. Likeliest resolution: these are NAM models
>   **normalized per batch**, so each revision's effective input level may differ (a CAPTURE
>   property, not a circuit one). **Cheapest arbiter: what input level was each revision's NAM model
>   captured at?** If unknown, the alternative is unwinding the stack (drop `kDriveEndR`, raise
>   `kInputRef`, and fit the DRIVE taper SHAPE — the error flips sign across the knob, dsp.md's
>   tell-tale that no single coefficient can fix).
>
> ### Gap H error 2 — NARROWED 2026-07-17: it is CAPTURE-vs-SPICE, and it is LINEAR
>
> - **The gap is LEVEL-INDEPENDENT ⇒ a LINEAR error, not compression** (`v1l_topoct_level_check.py`,
>   free — re-reads the JSON's 4 sweep levels). Worst capture's top-band gap: **−23.8 dB on the
>   near-linear CLEAN sweep**, −21.7/−24.4/−27.5 driven. **So Gap H is NOT blocked on Gap I's
>   deferred gain staging** — it can proceed independently.
> - **PRESENCE cannot close it (authority argument, no fitting).** Closed form from netlists.md L3:
>   at the capture's **P=0.75** the cell gives **+10.1 dB** @12.5 kHz; its absolute **ceiling** at
>   P=1.00 is **+27.3 dB**. Subtracting it, **the capture implies V1L's wet path is −28.3 dB @12.5
>   kHz while SPICE §1 says −40 dB — an 11.7 dB disagreement.**
> - **⇒ ERROR 2 IS CAPTURE vs SPICE.** (Note: error 1 — model darker than SPICE — was resolved
>   2026-07-18 by the R48/R49→22k override, so the model now follows §1 at ~10.1 kHz. Error 2 is the
>   SEPARATE, larger gap: the capture implies ~12 dB MORE top-octave HF than SPICE itself has.) Since
>   the plugin already satisfies both §1 and the schematic, and only the NAM capture wants more, **this
>   is an ARBITRATION with no arbiter — the matrix is FINAL.** "Do NOT retune the cab-sim/presence
>   against the capture" stands; likely best-effort schematic-faithful. (The matched-pair PRESENCE
>   capture that would have arbitrated is GONE — matrix FINAL. The **S-K stopband floor-out** angle
>   is now **CLOSED (2026-07-18, `analysis/v1l_sk_stopband_floor.py`): RULED OUT** — it can only
>   darken the top octave, not brighten it (C14=10n floors feedthrough at ~−56 dB, below the ideal
>   stopband), at any GBW/Ro. Only capture-free angle left: **re-read the §1 graph EDGE**, then close.)
> - **⚠ "The real circuit uses TL072 op-amps" was FACTUALLY WRONG and is deleted.** circuit.md:
>   *"TL072 only appears in the XLR driver, which we're not modelling."* V1L's S-K is **TLC2264**
>   (CMOS, GBW **0.72 MHz**) — not a TL072 (bipolar, 3 MHz). Use the right part's numbers.
>
> ### Gap H error 1 — RESOLVED 2026-07-18 (R48/R49 33k→22k, §1-match override)
> The §1 re-read paid off. `analysis/s1_crossrev_check.py`: at 33k the model separated V1E/V1L by
> **0.30 octave more** than the author's overlaid §1 curves do (which call them "broadly similar"),
> and V1E matched §1 while V1L missed by 0.26 — the robust *spacing* reading, immune to graph-edge
> error. Root causes of the false "CLOSED": the §1 target had been **edited to the model's own value**
> (L-001, `git log -L`-proven) and the two summing culprits (C42 + the 33k S-K corner) were killed
> **one at a time**. Per the user's "match the sim" call, set **R48/R49 = 22k** (V1E's value, the one
> recovery resistor that differs between revisions). Outcome: −40 dB point 9.16→10.08 kHz (within §1's
> ±⅓-oct), worst-capture top band **−25.3→−19.0 dB**, V1L median trust-rms **5.63→4.81**, no
> regression; §1 cell restored; gate rebuilt with teeth (measured to FAIL 33k). C42 left at schematic
> 4.7n. Full detail + the L-008/L-001/L-003 lessons: gap-audit "Error 1". **23/23 green.**
> **⚠ `analysis/reports/*` are STALE w.r.t. this change until the running regen finishes** (kicked off
> 2026-07-18, `phase10-regen-22k.log`); re-read them only after it completes.
>
> **NEXT: Gap H error 2 (~19 dB, DOMINANT, still open).** Capture-only; NOT PRESENCE / S-K / the S-K
> corner / compression. Suspects narrowed to a wet-path interaction or the C42 buffer's real HF shape.
> **May be UNRESOLVABLE on the FINAL matrix** — if the capture-free references (schematic + §1) are
> already satisfied and only the NAM capture disagrees, close it best-effort schematic-faithful and
> document the residual. Then Gap J+E (**one item — permanently confounded**) / Gap C.
>
> **Gap H error 2 (~19 dB, DOMINANT, OPEN) — read `phase10-gap-audit.md` §H "Error 2" for the live
> analysis.** Do not re-derive from here. Established: error 1 is now FIXED (S-K = **22k**, not the
> stale "33k schematic-faithful" that used to be written here); PRESENCE (§3, +27.5 dB) and the S-K
> cascade are each individually correct; the deficit is V1L-specific, LEVEL-INDEPENDENT (linear, not
> compression), and NOT the PRESENCE cell (authority argument). It is a CAPTURE-vs-SPICE
> disagreement; the "op-amp GBW (TL072)" candidate is **DELETED** — wrong part (V1L's S-K is
> TLC2264). Given the FINAL matrix it may be best-effort (schematic + §1 already satisfied).
> After error 2: Gap C, then Gap J+E.
>
> **LOCALISED (`analysis/v1l_shape_localise.py`, OS=8x, SHAPE metric).** V1L's worst capture (D0.65
> P0.75 **BL1.00** V0.35, rms **7.88**, max|Δ| **31.4**) is **75% ONE BAND**: 10–16 kHz, mean
> **−25.3 dB**, worst **−31.4 @ 12.5 kHz** — the plugin is far too DARK up top. BL=1.00 is FULL WET
> ⇒ the fault is in V1L's WET path, not the blend. Cross-revision control confirms it is
> V1L-SPECIFIC (mean 10–16k shape: V1E −0.0 | V2 −1.8 | **V1L −7.0**), so it is one of V1L's OWN
> stages — of the wet-path HF elements V1E/V2 don't share, **C42 is now ELIMINATED** (see below) and
> **the L5a/L5b S-K cab-sim** is the live suspect. **C10/R14 are EXONERATED — do NOT re-raise C10**
> (ISS-009).
>
> - **ATTRIBUTED — it is TWO stacked errors, and C42 is ELIMINATED (full detail: gap audit §H).**
>   **(1) ~10 dB is a REAL, capture-free model error:** at §1's OWN settings (P=0/D=0/tones-flat —
>   the ISS-009 matched-settings lesson) the plugin's HF −40 dB point is **9.16 kHz vs §1's ~11 kHz**
>   (−50.1 dB @ 11 kHz ⇒ ~10 dB too dark; ≈0.26 octaves early). **netlists.md's L5a/L5b `[◐ §1]` flag
>   has FIRED** — honour its instruction: re-examine the S-K **"(−) tied to OUT" unity reading FIRST**.
>   (V1L's L5a is R48/R49 **33k/33k** vs V1E's **22k/22k** → S-K#1 corner 2225 vs 3337 Hz; verify that
>   asymmetry is real first.) **(2) ~17 dB more is claimed ONLY by the capture** — either our PRESENCE
>   cell under-delivers HF (top-band leverage only 18.8 dB; even at P=1.00 the plugin reaches −26.6,
>   still 13 dB short of the pedal at P=0.75) or the NAM model mis-renders a barely-excited band.
>   **Arbitrate PRESENCE against §3 next — capture-free, same cell.** Fix (1) vs §1 BEFORE (2), and
>   **do NOT retune the cab-sim against the capture** (that folds error 2 into error 1's stage).
> - **C42 is DEAD as a suspect — do not fit it.** The wet buffer's gain is `1+(R27∥C42)/R12`, which
>   asymptotes to **unity** as `Zf→0`, so C42's ENTIRE authority is +10.1→0 dB = **10.1 dB**. It
>   cannot produce a 23–27 dB deficit. (An authority argument beats a sweep: free, and conclusive.)
> - **⚠ The band is knob-dependent, and the error SIGN FLIPS across captures** — top-band shape
>   −25.3 (BL1.00, P0.74) → **+6.2** (BL0.65, P0.70) → −1.9 (BL0.30, P0.65). A fixed cap cannot flip
>   sign. The **pedal's own** top band is likewise non-monotonic in blend (−13.6/−27.3/−9.9) while the
>   plugin's is monotonic. Never fit a fixed cap against one capture here — fit the SPREAD (kDriveEndR
>   lesson). (**The matched-pair route is GONE — the matrix is FINAL. PRESENCE can never be isolated
>   by capture; use §3 + the L3 closed form instead, both capture-free.**)
> - **A hypothesis I tested and REFUTED — do not re-run it:** "the 10–16k band on a full-wet V1L
>   capture is below the NAM model's noise floor, so −31 dB is noise" (§1 says V1L's wet path is
>   ~−40 dB by 11–12 kHz, so this was plausible, and it is the ISS-011 pattern). **FALSE.**
>   `analysis/capture_band_snr.py` measures each file's own inter-segment silence gap: **every band of
>   every V1L capture has 84–129 dB SNR** (noise floor −146..−160 dBFS; the 10–16k band on the 7.88
>   capture reads **+105.5 dB SNR**, sitting −25.0 dB re its own peak band). **Durable fact: these
>   captures are NAM MODEL OUTPUT, so "silence" is a net emitting ~zero — there is no analog noise
>   floor and SNR is NEVER a reason to distrust a band.** (Caveat: that measures the model's noise
>   floor, not its ACCURACY 25 dB below peak — high SNR refutes "we're measuring noise"; it does not
>   by itself prove a quiet band is trustworthy.)

> ### P6 root cause — the DRIVE taper was never fit (commit 2040250)
> `V1EarlyDriveStage` used the ideal schematic law `Rvr1=(1-d)*100k` → literal 0 Ω at max → +40.1 dB,
> cross-validated only against the author's SPICE sim (which also assumes an ideal pot). The captures

> + ~~`kOutputMakeup[0] = 0.437`, `kDryGain[0] = 2.975`~~ (**both SUPERSEDED** — makeup is now
> T-002-anchored to dry-path unity, `kDryGain` is DELETED (ISS-008). `kDriveEndR=8k` still stands but
> **Gap I shows it is a compensator for a too-low `kInputRef`, not a real end-resistance** — L-008.)
> - **Rend and makeup are COUPLED** (an end-R lowers gain at EVERY knob position). Fit Rend on the
>   per-capture offset **SPREAD** (makeup shifts all three equally, so it cannot fix spread), then let
>   makeup absorb the common offset. Clean interior minimum at 8k: spread 3.65→0.96 dB.
> - Result: D1.00 FR rms 8.65→5.93 dB; knob-tracking err 100Hz +8.8→−0.7, 250 +10.1→+1.2, 12k +8.6→−1.0.
> - **CAVEAT:** 8k is ~8% of a 100k pot — far above real end/wiper R (<1%). It is an EMPIRICAL effective
>   value likely absorbing un-modelled gain limiting at high closed-loop gain (**TLC2264 GBW ≈0.72 MHz →
>   at gain 101 the closed-loop BW is only ~7 kHz**, so the ideal-op-amp model over-delivers). If it IS
>   GBW, the correct model is FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT — which would also attack the 3–4 kHz residual a flat
>   resistance cannot touch. **Test GBW before treating 8k as settled.**
> - `kDriveEndR` is exposed so `V1EarlyDriveTest` gates BOTH the schematic law at Rend=0 (+40.08 dB,
>   WDF-vs-analytic — the E3/E4 transcription cross-check is PRESERVED) and the fitted default (29.60 dB).

> ### V1E THD-onset fit — DONE (commit cb0fe9b)
> `setRecoverySaturation(0.080, 0.100)` → **(0.40, 0.25)** (still live), ~~`kOutputMakeup[0]` → 0.444~~
> (**SUPERSEDED by T-002 → 1.084**). **⚠ Gap I supersedes this fit's PREMISE:** it was scored partly on

> THD@100 rms err **4.11% → 1.02%** (D0.50 5.9 vs 4.5, D0.60 6.1 vs 6.7, D1.00 7.6 vs 8.5); FR shape
> 2.80 → 2.69 dB (no regression); offset spread unchanged 0.96 dB (doesn't disturb the taper fit).

> **⚠ A mid-session claim was WRONG and is corrected here:** "the rail knee moves D0.50 THD 0.6% →
> 36.8%" was measured **with an illegal rail drop to 2.4 V**. At the LOCKED ±4.2 V rail the knee has

>
> ### Two false "structural" verdicts — distrust this pattern
> Both were written off after ONE candidate failed. Neither was structural:
> 1. **P6** — the audit's only candidate was asymmetric rails, which HAD to fail: the collapse is in the

>    OUT as P6's cause by proof:** a memoryless saturator cannot compress a sine ~8 dB while producing
>    only ~8.5% THD (every setting that compressed enough blew THD to 62.5% vs the pedal's 8.5%).
> 2. **V1E THD residual** — degenerate parameter, not a model limit (above).

> ### T-001 — "Fix V1E THD slope (gap A)" — ⚠ REMOVED 2026-07-17: IT NEVER WORKED

**T-001 never did anything audible** (−53..−77 dB, and biggest at the drive where nothing clips).
**It is now removed** — the chain is bit-identical to pre-T-001 (6b74276^), so every fit made at that
state (`kDriveEndR=8k`, saturator 0.40/0.25, `kOutputMakeup`) is untouched and valid.
Full forensics in `docs/phase10-gap-audit.md` Gap A′; the short version, because this is the most
instructive failure in the project so far — **four faults, each of which any other would have
caught**:

1. **The filter didn't implement its own formula.** `GbwCorrection.h` claims `H(s)=s/(s+wCl)` but had
   `b0=wa/D` (needs `(2/Ts)/D`) and a flipped `a1` sign → pole at **Nyquist**, not DC → **−49 dB** at
   G_cl=101. The DC zero was right, so the *slope* looked correct while the *magnitude* was ~340× low.
   **FIXED 2026-07-17** (now 0.0 dB vs analytic).
2. **The gate can't fail.** `V1EarlyTHDSweepTest` G1 tests only the **ratio** — it passed at
   THD@100 = **0.12%** before the fix and **0.71%** after (pedal: **9.79%**). A 6× magnitude swing,
   identical verdict. One drive (1.00), saturator OFF, target from **theory** — never a capture.
3. **The next line discards it.** `processCoreDrive` returns ~**30.3 V unclipped** at D=1.00;
   `processCoreSample` then clamps to ±5.2 and `railClip`s it. The hard clip does all audible work,
   exactly as pre-T-001. The ±5.2 clamp is the model fighting itself.
4. **The mechanism cannot apply to the rail.** `linear + residEff` with `residEff→0` at LF asserts a
   30 V swing from an 8.4 V supply. **Feedback cannot correct rail saturation** — it is the output
   stage's hard limit, outside the loop's authority. Fixing the maths does NOT rescue this.

**And the premise may be an artefact too — see Gap G.** THD-vs-frequency is **unusable on this pedal**:
the twin-T (~800 Hz, ALL revs) cuts the **fundamental** while harmonics generated downstream pass
unattenuated, so THD inflates near the notch. Pedal THD is a *bump on the notch* (V1E D1.00: 9.79% @100
→ **69%** @600 → 1.4% @4k), not a slope. Only ~60–200 Hz is clean, and it's non-monotonic (L-002).
A pedal−plugin delta does NOT rescue it (the plugin's notch is ~11 dB too deep — Gap B).

**Standing rule this earns:** *a gate that only checks a RATIO cannot detect a model that does
nothing.* Gate on **magnitude vs a capture**, at **≥3 drive settings**, saturator **on** — and verify
the gate FAILS when you delete the feature it guards.

### Gap H diagnostic results — Error 1 FIXED 2026-07-18, Error 2 OPEN
- **Error 1 (S-K cab-sim rolloff) — FIXED (R48/R49 33k→22k, §1-match override):**
  - H1 (non-unity gain) — FAILED. Unity structurally correct. (durable)
  - H2 (R48/R49=22k) — ⚠ was REJECTED 2026-07-17 on "schematic is 33k", **that rejection is now
    REVERSED**: the §1 cross-revision SPACING (`s1_crossrev_check.py`) showed 33k separates V1E/V1L
    0.30 octave more than the author's own sim, and the user chose the sim. **22k applied.** −40 dB
    point 9.16→10.08 kHz; worst-capture top band −25.3→−19.0 dB. Gate rebuilt with teeth (fails 33k).
  - The old "H2E: 9.16 kHz within tolerance, schematic-faithful" verdict is VOID — it rested on a §1
    target that had been edited to the model's own value (L-001).
- **Error 2 (~19 dB, top-octave, DOMINANT) — OPEN:**
  - §3 arbitration (`analysis/v1l_presence_s3_check.py`): ISOLATED PRESENCE cell IS faithful
    (+27.5 dB @ 6–7 kHz at P=1.0 per V1LateStagesTest analytic).
  - S-K cascade is also faithful (error 1). Both stages individually correct.
  - Error **flips sign** across captures (−27.4 → +6.7 → −2.6 dB) tracking PRESENCE/BLEND.
  - Band SNR is +105.5 dB — captures ARE trustworthy at 10–16 kHz (NOT a NAM artefact).
  - The deficit is V1L-specific (V2 with same presence cell reads −1.8 dB top-band).
  - LEVEL-INDEPENDENT ⇒ linear, not compression (`v1l_topoct_level_check.py`).
  - **Candidates (updated 2026-07-18):** NOT op-amp GBW/non-ideality — the wrong-part TL072
    hypothesis was DELETED, and the S-K **stopband floor-out is now RULED OUT** too
    (`analysis/v1l_sk_stopband_floor.py`: it can only DARKEN, not brighten — the audit's assumed
    sign was wrong, C14=10n floors feedthrough at ~−56 dB below the ideal stopband, at any GBW/Ro);
    NOT PRESENCE (authority argument); NOT C42 (authority argument, eliminated — its ceiling is
    10.1 dB). Remaining: a wet-path stage INTERACTION, or a genuine schematic-vs-SPICE disagreement
    the FINAL matrix cannot arbitrate ⇒ **likely best-effort schematic-faithful**. Last capture-free
    move: **re-read the §1 graph EDGE**. See `phase10-gap-audit.md` §H "Error 2" — authoritative copy.

### Open items (see phase10-gap-audit.md for the live copy; Gap H error 1 FIXED 2026-07-18, error 2 OPEN)
> - **Gap B: V1E + V2 drive-dependent band saturation** — 800 Hz notch fill, 3-4 kHz +7.7 dB.
> - **V1E THD onset** — plugin now uniformly too clean at every drive (0.7–5.2% vs pedal 4.5–9.8%): the
>   taper fix removed the excess gain that was MASKING absent saturation (old D1.00 THD match was two
>   errors cancelling). Single coherent cause; rail-knee leverage already proven. **NEXT.**
> - **P6 shape residual** — isolated to two bands: 800 Hz (plugin notch 11 dB too deep; pedal's fills in
>   at drive) and 3–4 kHz (+8.7 dB; pedal gains only +5.6 dB there D0.50→D1.00 vs plugin +13.1).
>   Drive-dependent band saturation — same class as V2 zener tracking. **Answer the GBW question first.**
> - **V2 zener drive tracking** — knee/softness needs drive-dependence.
> - P1 residual: V2 12.5k/16k — see Gap C row (re-derived on SHAPE 2026-07-18; the old "recovery LPF
>   cascade warp" cause is REFUTED — 8x oversamples that cascade; residual is base-rate tone-stack + OS droop).
> - P2 residual: BASS=0.35/0.50 250–430 Hz hump correlates with MID shift throw, not BASS Q (C27 tested).
> - V1L blend residual: +6 dB at BL=0.65 is NodalCircuit impedance loading — not fixable by a scalar.
- **ISS-008 — V2 dry-path HF excess at BL<1.00 — SOLVED + CLOSED (2026-07-16).** Root cause was
  **`kDryGain`, an unphysical per-path scalar — now DELETED; never reintroduce one** (see the long
  do-not-do note at the bottom of `Calibration.h`). `kDryGain[rev]=kInputRef/kOutputMakeup[rev]`
  boosted ONLY the dry leg, multiplying the dry/wet ratio by +9.5/+8.1/**+20.5 dB** (V1E/V1L/V2).
  **Why the reasoning was wrong:** kOutputMakeup is applied ONCE, GLOBALLY (`outputGainFor`), so it
  scales dry and wet EQUALLY and cannot skew their balance — the ratio is the CIRCUIT's job (that's
  what the BLEND pot models). Invisible at BL=1.00, growing as BL falls = the exact symptom.
  - **Results:** V2 BL0.90 FR rms 10.15→**3.51** dB (12k +27.1→+8.2); BL0.95 8.22→**2.82** (12k
    +24.4→+7.1); V1L BL0.65 null −9.6→**−12.7**; BL0.30 −1.9→**−4.1**. All five BL=1.00 captures
    unchanged within 0.1 dB (dry-leg-only signature). **Also fixes ISS-006** (whose "not fixable by a
    scalar" verdict was exactly wrong — it WAS a scalar) and unmasks ISS-003.
  - **Bonus corroboration:** the hot dry leaked through the BLEND pot's cap-limited off-side even at
    BL=1.00, filling the notch. Removing it moved every §1 feature toward SPICE: notch −21.9→**−26.7**
    (target −36), LF edge **+5.2→−4.4** (target −15; a POSITIVE LF edge was never physical).
  - **Both prior candidates were REFUTED — don't re-try.** (a) "unmodelled dry HF rolloff": the
    schematic itself (`v2_TL_2x.png`) shows U1B pin 7 → straight into BLEND VR50.a, **no component**;
    the netlist was right. (d) "NAM can't capture dry HF": the **V1L BL=0.30 control (70% dry, same
    bare-wire tap) reads only −9.1 dB @12.9k** — dry HF captures fine.
  - **⚠ THE PREMISE WAS FALSE.** The headline "+54 dB @12.9k / pedal −63.3 dB" came ENTIRELY from the
    matrix's only **`_2` take, which is CORRUPT** (ISS-011): it holds LESS raw 8–16k energy (−49.7 dB)
    than its own FULL-WET siblings (−42.8..−46.8) — impossible with 50% bare-wire dry in the mix.
    **kDryGain had been fit to that one file** (cef46ff: "BL=0.50 NULL +16.8→−0.1"). One bad capture
    fitted a constant that damaged five good ones. The memory's "dry+wet phase-CANCEL at BL0.50" note
    traces to the same file and is void.
  - **GATE ARCHAEOLOGY — the durable lesson.** cef46ff *also widened the gate that would have caught
    it*: the dry-path check went from Phase-6.3's correct `±12 dB` "near-unity" band to `+5..+40 dB`
    (a 35 dB window) because kDryGain forced +24.66 dB. **Restored to ±12 dB; now reads +4.18 dB** =
    the circuit's own value. When a fit fails a gate, suspect the fit — **`git log -L` on the gate
    line is the fastest way to catch this class** (it found this in one command).
  - **The corrupt capture is now QUARANTINED (ISS-011, done):** moved to
    `analysis/captures-quarantine/` (not deleted). `find_captures()` globs `analysis/captures/*.wav`,
    so it is invisible to every script — **the matrix is 11 captures now, and V2 BLEND=0.50 has NO
    capture; fit nothing to that setting.** The `.wav`s are gitignored, so the evidence lives in the
    tracked `analysis/captures-quarantine/README.md` — read it before ever restoring a file there.
  - Follow-ups: **ISS-012 — RESOLVED by T-002 (2026-07-17).** The old "kOutputMakeup was fit to
    NAM-normalized = meaningless absolute level" concern is addressed — kOutputMakeup is now anchored
    to dry-path unity at blend=0, level=0.5 rather than to capture-normalized levels.
    New probes: `analysis/iss008_dry_probe.py`, `analysis/iss008_rate_check.py`. 23/23 green (full `-j8` build).
>
> - **ISS-009 — V1L "C10 LF deficit": C10 EXONERATED, no code change (2026-07-16). DO NOT RAISE C10.**
  The netlists.md L5d `[◐]` gate fired and is now **CLOSED `[✓]`**: the re-crop
  (`v1-late_TR_2x.png`) confirms **C10 `10n` / R14 `100k`** exactly as modelled. §1 is *consistent*
  with a 159 Hz HP (its V1L column implies a 10.5 dB bump→LF-edge drop; a lone 159 Hz pole drops
  8.3 dB), and the plugin measures **12.6 dB at §1 conditions**. 100n would collapse the delta to ~0.
  - **The −12.9 dB "deficit" is DRIVE-DEPENDENT, and C10 is a FIXED cap** → it cannot be the cause.
    Attribution (`analysis/iss009_lf_probe.py` §3): D=0 → **12.6 dB** (correct) | D=0.65 → **17.8**
    (+8.2 vs the capture's own 9.6) | BASS→0.5 → 18.5 (**BASS is not the cause**) | **DRIVE→0 → 12.9
    (correct again)**. Split out as **ISS-013**; cascade §B already flags `LF <100Hz` DRIVE-DEPENDENT
    on V1E (swing 9.1 dB) and V2 (3.92) — one shared mechanism, same class as ISS-001/002/004.
  - **Two traps this cost, both now recorded:** (1) the old "−4.7 dB SPICE LF edge" was *ad-hoc*
    (`spice_target_check.py` has **no §1 mode for V1L**, only §8), used an **absolute** dB against a
    curve the doc says is "each normalised its own way", and predated ISS-008. Use the
    **normalization-free** metric (bump-peak→25 Hz **delta**, both points off the same curve).
    (2) **Compare at MATCHED KNOB SETTINGS** — §1 is D=0/P=0/tones-flat; the captures are not. The
    whole "deficit" was a §1-vs-capture-settings mismatch.
  - **A hypothesis I tested and REFUTED — don't re-run it:** "NAM captures are LF-blind so a correct
    plugin reads as falsely deficient." **FALSE** — the captures carry real LF rolloff, in §1's range
    (own bump→25 Hz deltas: V1E 6.0/13.8/14.5, **V1L 9.6**, V2 5.4/8.4/9.2). V1L's 9.6 **agrees** with
    §1's 10.5. Captures CAN arbitrate LF; they just weren't being compared like-for-like.
  - **⚠ SELF-CORRECTION — the drive-attribution table above (12.6/17.8/18.5/12.9) is CONTAMINATED;
    don't cite it.** It spawned **ISS-013**, which I then **closed as INVALID** by testing its own
    candidate (c). Two compounding faults: the metric was **peak-referenced** (the low bump migrates
    100→117 Hz with drive, moving the reference), and its **25 Hz anchor is estimator noise**. Fixed-
    frequency re-measure (`analysis/iss013_drive_lf.py`, plugin-only, 200 Hz ref): the plugin's LF is
    **drive-INDEPENDENT within 2.24 dB at 40–100 Hz on all three revs**. **C10's exoneration is
    UNAFFECTED** — it rests on the schematic re-crop + §1, never on that table.
- **⚠ TWO MEASUREMENT RULES THAT HAVE NOW COST TWO WRONG CONCLUSIONS (N-004):**
  **(1) NEVER anchor LF work at 25 Hz — use 40–100 Hz.** The ref is a 10 s log sweep from 20 Hz read by
  Welch/CSD (`nperseg=8192` → 5.9 Hz bins averaged over the whole segment), so 25 Hz is the least-
  supported bin, and V1L sits lowest there (its C10 HP). **V1L's 25 Hz reading swings 21.4 dB
  NON-MONOTONICALLY across a single knob** — no linear filter can; it's noise, and it fabricated a ~5 dB
  effect. **(2) Prefer FIXED reference frequencies over PEAK-referenced metrics** — a migrating peak
  manufactures a delta with no real level change. **Sanity-check any LF number for MONOTONICITY across a
  knob sweep**; that one check caught both.
- **The LF band is a SECOND, independent probe of clip onset (folded into ISS-001).** The plugin's LF is
  drive-independent (≤2.24 dB) but cascade §B's LF column (plugin−capture) swings **9.10 dB (V1E)** /
  3.92 (V2) — so that swing is **the PEDAL's** drive-dependence, not the plugin's. **LF is where the wet
  path is LOUDEST** (the twin-T scoops ~800 Hz → LF passes at full drive gain), so it hits the pedal's
  clip first and hardest: the pedal compresses, the plugin under-clips and stays flat. Same fault as
  ISS-001's THD slope, seen in the FR instead of the harmonics — and **immune to the THD anchor traps**
  (V1E THD is 100/200 Hz only). Fit clip onset against BOTH.

- **T-002 — Level=0.5, Blend=0.0 = unity gain — DONE (2026-07-17).** kOutputMakeup[rev] now
  anchored to `1.0 / V_dsp_dry_gain` so DAW output = input at blend=0, level=0.5 (all other
  knobs at noon, V1L/V2 volume switches OFF). The prior capture-level-fit values are superseded;
  capture analysis normalizes levels independently so this is shape-neutral. See Calibration.h
  T-002 ANCHOR comment. Integration test dry-path gates tightened to catch accidental stage changes.

### Lessons (hard-won, do not re-learn)

- **L-014: A destructive-interference NULL is a PHASE defect — diagnose and fix it with phase, never
  with a magnitude-only correction (which feeds it more amplitude and deepens it).** V1L's bass-hump
  investigation (item 1) tried a magnitude pole-zero filter that converged beautifully on an ISOLATED
  test (dry forced to zero) — peak and LF-edge both landed on §1's targets — then FAILED the project's
  own existing gate (`V1LateIntegrationTest`'s §1 check) at the REAL reference condition, because the
  isolated test never included the dry leg the correction would actually sum against. Magnitude-boosting
  the wet path's LF content didn't fix the null the pedal doesn't have; it fed more amplitude into the
  same phase-misaligned sum and made the null ~10 dB DEEPER. The tell that should have caught it
  earlier: a magnitude correction tuned against an artificially isolated signal is a different
  measurement than rendering at the SAME knob settings through the real, complete signal path — always
  validate the latter, not a proxy, especially when the deficit involves TWO signals summing (dry+wet,
  L+R, any parallel path) rather than one signal passing through one stage. Once reframed as a phase
  problem — measured directly via a complex-transfer comparison across revisions (V1E/V2 track each
  other within a few degrees at 25-100 Hz; V1L carries a consistent ~45-52° excess) — a PHASE-ONLY
  (allpass, unity magnitude) correction fixed the null and the peak TOGETHER without the magnitude
  side-effect, and never regressed at any tested setting. General rule: before building a magnitude
  correction for a dip/null, ask whether the dip could be two signals cancelling — if so, measure
  phase, not just magnitude, before choosing the correction's shape. Sibling of L-004 (validate the
  premise before modelling a mechanism) and L-010 (compute magnitude before building) — L-014 adds
  "and check you're computing the magnitude of the right QUANTITY (phase vs level)."
- **L-013: A LINEAR schematic value altered to flatten one FR band silently moves a POLE/CORNER
  everywhere else — audit for it by comparing each shipped component value to the schematic, not by
  re-measuring.** The bass-hump-frequency error (item 1) was TWO independent instances of the same
  bug: V2's C41 was changed 22n→15n (f3f81f9) to shave a ~0.3 dB "200-630 Hz hump", and V1E's C12 was
  changed 47n→220n (6427d0a) to lift "sub-100 Hz". Each is a coupling cap; each move relocated the
  HP corner and dragged the LF bump PEAK by ~⅓ octave — in OPPOSITE directions (C41 smaller→corner
  up→peak up; C12 bigger→corner down→peak down), which is exactly why item 1 saw V2/V1L reading HIGH
  and V1E reading LOW and (per L-010) wrongly doubted a shared cause. The tells, all present: (1) the
  commit messages themselves say "adjust C41 from 22n" / "increased from 47n to 220n" — a schematic
  designator with a non-schematic value is the receipt (L-008); (2) BOTH self-validation gates had
  been neutered — `V2RecoveryTest` kept the 22n analytic ref but never probed below 100 Hz where the
  corner has authority (L-003), and `V1EarlyBlendLevelTest`'s analytic ref was edited to 220n to
  match the fudge (L-001); (3) the "fix" each bought was marginal (0.3 dB / a couple dB) versus the
  ⅓-oct peak error it created. **Do NOT flatten an FR band by nudging a schematic cap — a coupling
  cap owns a corner, and a corner owns the shape of the whole bump. Fix the real cause or use a named
  calibration layer (guardrail #1).** Restoring both schematic values fixed V1E outright and improved
   V2, with the gates re-armed to fail on the fudge. Sibling of L-008 (unphysical value = receipt) and
   L-001 (suspect the fit, `git log -L` the value/gate).
   **Qualification (2026-07-20):** The core warning stands — a coupling cap owns its corner, and
   changing it silently pollutes the whole bump shape. HOWEVER, quickly testing a cap value as a
   DIAGNOSTIC ("does this corner cause the deficit I see?") is cheap and can reveal the real cause in
   minutes versus hours. The sin was not the value change itself — it was failing to revert or
   document it, and neutering the gate to match. A value probe with a clean commit message, a `[PROBE]`
   tag, and an intact gate that would catch a silent merge is fine and should not be discouraged.
- **L-001: When a fit fails a gate, suspect the fit — `git log -L` the gate line.** If a calibration
  fit makes an existing test fail, do NOT widen the test. The commit that added the constant may also
  have loosened the gate to accommodate it. One `git log -L` command found this in ISS-008 (kDryGain
  forced +24.66 dB; the gate was widened from ±12 dB to +5..+40 dB to hide it). Sibling of the
  standing rule "a capture-fit must never silently erase a schematic-verification gate."
- **L-010: A mechanism argument is not evidence until you COMPUTE ITS MAGNITUDE — and check the
  topology actually admits the mechanism you are picturing.** Gap D's coupling-cap hypothesis was
  argued qualitatively ("a flat-topped wave through a series RC tilts in-cycle, so the corner is the
  wrong thing to look at"), corroborated by a clean cross-revision pattern (V1E has no such caps and
  no anomaly; V1L's 2.2u reaches higher than V2's 1u), and written up as DECIDED/ACTIONABLE. It was
  implemented and moved the target metric by **0.11 dB out of ~5 dB required** — 0.00 dB on the
  isolated stage. **Two independent tells, both available for free, before any code:** (1) The
  magnitude was never computed. One line — |H| = (f/fc)/√(1+(f/fc)²) = **0.990 at 110 Hz** — kills
  it outright; a 0.99-gain linear filter cannot shed 5 dB of harmonics. (2) **The mental picture did
  not match the topology.** The "~60% tilt per cycle" that made it feel plausible is the
  open-circuit droop of a **disconnected** cap; here the op-amp (−) input is a virtual ground, i.e.
  a permanent resistive return, so the network is a plain LTI highpass and never enters a hold
  phase. **Ask "which node would have to float for my picture to be true?" and then check whether it
  does.** Also: a cross-revision pattern that matches on a component's PRESENCE is much weaker
  evidence than it feels — V1E lacks the whole zener module, so it corroborates every hypothesis
  about anything inside that module equally. Sibling of L-004 (which asks whether the *measurement*
  is an artefact); L-010 asks whether the *mechanism* has the authority to produce the measured
  size — the same authority argument that correctly killed C42 and PRESENCE in Gap H, simply not
  applied here.
- **L-011: A MAGNITUDE-only gate cannot detect a model that does the right thing BACKWARDS — and
  when several revisions share a stage, "the odd one out is the broken one" is a fallacy.** Two
  shipped stages were polarity-inverted for the whole project (`TwinTNotch` on all three revisions;
  V1L's L5d wet buffer). Every per-stage gate here compares dB, and **|−H| = |H|** — including
  `TwinTAuthorityProbe`, written *specifically* to audit the twin-T, which reported 0.111 dB
  agreement while the phase was 180.0° out at every frequency. **Cheap fix, general: when a stage has
  an analytic reference, compare the COMPLEX transfer, not its magnitude.** The reference already
  existed; only `abs()` stood in the way. Second half of the lesson: the cross-revision comparison
  said V1L was ~190° from V1E and V2, so V1L looked guilty — but V1L carried BOTH flips and therefore
  CANCELLED, i.e. it was the only correct one. **A shared upstream stage moves the majority together,
  so agreement between revisions is not evidence of correctness; only an ABSOLUTE reference decides.**
  Sibling of L-003 (which asks whether the gate can fail); L-011 asks whether the gate can even SEE
  the quantity that is wrong.
- **L-012: To separate "circuit error" from "numerics error", SWEEP THE OVERSAMPLING FACTOR. It is
  free and it is decisive.** Gap J (a deep, narrow, blend-tracking 285 Hz notch, open since
  2026-07-17 and written up as a wet-path group-delay fault) was the dry tap never being time-aligned
  with the oversampled wet path: dry + wet summed ~84 samples apart at 8x is a COMB, first null at
  `fs/(2·84)` ≈ 285 Hz. **Oversampling is a numerical choice and MUST NOT change the modelled
  circuit** — so anything that moves with the OS factor is ours, and anything that does not is the
  model. One sweep (OS 1/2/4/8) showed the null absent at 1x, deepening with the factor, and its
  FREQUENCY tracking the latency (359 → 320 → 285 Hz). **Make that invariant a GATE**
  (`DryTapAlignmentTest`): every blend/FR gate in this project ran at ONE OS factor, so a defect
  whose entire signature is "changes with the OS factor" was invisible to all of them. Corollary for
  any dry/wet or parallel-path architecture: **a latency-bearing region in ONE leg needs an explicit
  delay in the other**, and the symptom is a comb, which reads convincingly as a filter/phase bug.
- **L-003: A gate that checks only a RATIO cannot detect a model that does nothing.** T-001's gate
  passed identically at 0.12% and 0.71% THD (pedal: 9.79%) because it only compared THD(200)/THD(100).
  Gate on **magnitude against a capture**, across **≥3 knob settings**, with neighbouring stages ON —
  and prove the gate FAILS when the feature it guards is deleted. Sibling of L-001: a gate written
  against a THEORETICAL prediction rather than a measurement will certify a no-op. See Gap A′.
- **L-005: A metric compared against LEVEL-NORMALIZED captures must normalize level — and a
  docstring is not evidence that it does.** `ab_report.fr_check` claimed (in the module docstring)
  to gain-match and never did; it read a raw `plugin − pedal` dB difference against NAM-normalized
  captures whose absolute level is arbitrary. It stayed invisible for the worst possible reason:
  `kOutputMakeup` was FIT to those captures, so the offset was ~0 **by construction** — the metric
  was silently measuring "how well did we fit the makeup", and looked fine. The instant T-002 moved
  that anchor for an unrelated (and correct) reason, the metric manufactured a "V2 broadband FR
  mismatch" out of a pure scalar. **Three tells, any one of which was enough:** (1) the offset was
  UNIFORM across all anchors — real EQ faults are frequency-selective; (2) it appeared on all five
  V2 captures at once, including BL=1.00, where the proposed blend-leakage mechanism *cannot* act;
  (3) its size (+14.0 dB) exactly equalled a constant that had just changed. **Distinct from L-001:**
  nothing was widened to hide it — `git log -L :fr_check:` shows it was born raw, so "suspect the
  fit, git log -L the gate" would NOT have caught this. The check that does: **ask what the metric
  reads when the model is perfect but the level is arbitrary.** Sibling of L-004 (which asks whether
  the *phenomenon* is an artefact); this asks whether the *comparison* is.
- **L-008: An UNPHYSICAL fitted value is a receipt for an error UPSTREAM of it — go find that error
  instead of shipping the fudge. And a fit that compensates for another fit builds a STACK, where
  each layer hides the one beneath.** Gap I is four deep: `kInputRef` 3.27 → **0.87** (*"recalibrate
  to monarch-of-tone's real-capture value"* — **a different pedal's constant**) ⇒ the plugin
  under-clips ⇒ the D1.00 clean-sweep FR reads "+8 dB too loud" (really: **the pedal compresses and
  the plugin doesn't** — CLAUDE.md's own measurement trap says so in as many words) ⇒ **`kDriveEndR`
  = 8k** invented, deleting **10.5 dB of real, schematic-verified gain** ⇒ almost no clipping left ⇒
  **`RecoverySaturator` 0.40/0.25** added to fake distortion back in ⇒ a static tanh cannot track
  level ⇒ Gap I. **The receipt was written down and ignored:** the docs already flagged 8k as
  *"~8% of a 100k pot — far above real end/wiper R (<1%) ... an EMPIRICAL effective value likely
  absorbing un-modelled gain limiting"*. That sentence is the bug report. **When a fit only works at
  a physically absurd value, the constant it is compensating for is the thing to question** — here,
  `git log -L` on `kInputRef` found the seed in one command (sibling of L-001). Corollary: a
  parameter fitted against a metric that is itself contaminated by a *nonlinearity* (an FR read where
  the pedal compresses) is fitting the wrong quantity entirely.
- **L-009: You cannot prove a feature does nothing with a switch that does nothing — verify the
  switch CHANGES THE OUTPUT before believing a null result.** `--sat-gain 0` could not disable the
  saturator: the guard `if (satGain > 0.0 && satKnee > 0.0)` **skipped the setter**, leaving the
  prepare()-time default (V1E 0.40/0.25) in place, so "saturator deleted" rendered **bit-identical**
  to the default — for as long as the flag has existed. Every V1E saturator-off experiment was
  measuring it at full strength. Two more the same day: `--sat-offset 0` (`!= 0.0`), and `argVal`
  returning the FIRST match so any trailing `--drive` override was silently ignored (because
  `render_args()` already emits it) — which reads as "the knob has no effect". **"0 means use the
  default" and "0 means zero" cannot share an encoding; use a sentinel.** This is L-003's mirror:
  L-003 says prove the gate fails without the feature — L-009 says make sure you can actually remove
  it. A null result from an unverified switch is not evidence of anything.
  **⚠ EXTENSION (2026-07-19) — IT HAPPENED AGAIN, IN A FLAG THE FIRST FIX DIDN'T AUDIT.**
  `--rail-vneg/--rail-vpos` encoded "unspecified" as `±4.2`, which is a LEGAL VALUE. Because V1E's
  `prepare()` default is asymmetric (−4.10/+4.20), asking for a SYMMETRIC rail silently rendered
  −4.10 — so the flag could not express symmetric at all, and **every scan grid containing −4.2
  duplicated the −4.10 column**, including the fit that chose the shipped −4.10. The 2026-07-17 fix
  repaired the three saturator flags that had bitten someone and left the identical defect next to
  them for two days. **When you find a sentinel defect in one flag, AUDIT EVERY FLAG THAT ENCODES
  "unspecified" AS A LEGAL VALUE — the bug class is the finding, not the one instance.** Also learn
  the tell: **two different flag values producing identical numbers while the value between them
  differs is not physics.** And verify the switch **per revision** — proving it live on V1E and then
  drawing a null conclusion about V1L is L-009 wearing a different hat.
- **L-006: Validate an ESTIMATOR against an independent measurement before believing any number it
  produces — and when it carries its own "validate me" note, that note is a defect report.**
  `analyze.harmonic_thd_curve`'s docstring said *"VALIDATE against discrete-tone thd() before trusting
  it"* for the entire project and nobody ever did. It was wrong: the Farina deconvolution divides by
  the reference sweep's spectrum, which has **no energy above SWEEP_F1=20 kHz**, so each order blows
  up into a **spurious edge spike at exactly f = 20000/N** (H7 measured −53 dB @2800 → **−16.8 @2874**
  → −77 @3000). That fabricated "plugin THD 14.0% vs pedal 2.4% @2874 Hz" on nearly every V1E capture
  — reported as a real finding for as long as the report existed. **The trick that made validation
  possible despite a level mismatch: a BRACKET test.** The tones are −14 dBFS, the sweeps −18/−12, so
  no single sweep compares — but −14 lies *between*, so a sound reading must satisfy `THD(−18) <=
  THD_tone(−14) <= THD(−12)`. That needs no assumption about the exact level. **Two tells were
  visible without any of this:** the spike was one band wide with sane neighbours on both sides, and
  it disagreed with the per-order rss from *its own decomposition*. **A number bracketed by two
  consistent numbers is the artefact, not the discovery.** Fixed via order limiting; proven
  bit-identical below 2714 Hz on all 11 captures (`analysis/farina_regression_check.py`), so no fit
  moved. Sibling of L-005: L-005 asks whether the *comparison* is sound, L-006 whether the
  *estimator* is.
  **⚠ EXTENSION (2026-07-19) — THE BRACKET GUARD ITSELF IS PARTLY BROKEN AS USED.** It asks
  `sweep(−18) <= tone(−14) <= sweep(−12)`, which fuses **ORDERING** (does THD rise with level?) with
  **AGREEMENT** (do the two estimators give the same magnitude?). Only agreement is evidence about the
  estimator. On a **flat or falling** THD curve the ordering fails for reasons that have nothing to do
  with the estimator — and flat curves are exactly the regime you invoke it in, so it **begs the
  question**: V1E D1.00 @4 kHz reports "bracket FAIL" while the estimators agree to **0.03 pp**.
  Conversely a flat curve makes the bracket **trivially satisfiable**, so "ok" is not a pass either.
  **Low power in BOTH directions, precisely where it is most used.** ⇒ compare
  **|tone − nearest sweep|**, and report ordering separately as a statement about the CIRCUIT.
  Some `✗ bracket (L-006)` rejections in `gapd_anchor_map.py` are therefore SPURIOUS — re-check any
  anchor rejected on bracket grounds before treating it as unusable. Tool:
  `analysis/hf_thd_flatness_check.py`.
- **L-007: "Disagrees with everything else" is a QUESTION, not a verdict — and the tool that asks it
  must compare at matched settings.** ISS-011's corrupt capture damaged five good ones, so a tripwire
  is worth having (`analysis/capture_outlier_scan.py`). But the same signature has two opposite
  causes: a corrupt file, **or the only capture at settings that expose a real bug** — `V1L D0.40
  BL0.30` is the largest FR outlier in the matrix *and* it is the sole evidence for Gap J. Only a
  **capture-intrinsic** proof (physics, plugin never involved — ISS-011 had two) can convict; plugin-
  vs-capture disagreement finds a GAP, never a bad capture. **The first draft of that tool accused two
  perfectly good captures** by comparing HF across files whose DRIVE differed — ISS-009's
  matched-settings trap, re-learned inside the very tool built to prevent this class. Scope the
  confounder set by *authority in the band under test* (at 8–16 kHz: presence/treble/drive matter;
  bass/mid/shift switches do not). **Result: the matrix has only two blend-matched pairs and both
  pass — V1E has none at all, so it cannot self-police.**
- **L-004: Before modelling a mechanism, check the metric that motivated it isn't an artefact.**
  T-001 modelled finite GBW to fix a "THD-vs-frequency slope" that is very likely just the twin-T
  notching the FUNDAMENTAL (harmonics are generated downstream and pass unattenuated, so THD inflates
  near any in-path notch). Four faults compounded on top of a premise nobody had validated. Ask "could
  this measurement be produced by something other than the mechanism I'm about to build?" FIRST.
- **L-002: Verify a derived metric before building on it — check monotonicity across a knob sweep.**
  A migrating reference point or a low-SNR anchor bin will manufacture an effect that does not exist.
  Prefer FIXED reference frequencies over peak-referenced ones, and never anchor on the
  least-supported point of your excitation. ISS-013 was filed then closed as INVALID within one
  session because a peak-referenced delta + 25 Hz noise anchor fabricated a ~5 dB effect. The tell
  was monotonicity: V1L's 25 Hz column swung 21.4 dB non-monotonically across one knob — no linear
  filter can do that. **See N-004: never anchor LF at 25 Hz; use 40–100 Hz.**

> **#2 OS/ADAA on the V1L/V2 zener DRIVE (2026-07-13):** `ZenerDriveClipRecovery.h` (templated on the

> needs a long settle window in a sine-sweep measurement, or a not-yet-decayed transient reads as a
> too-shallow cut (measurement artifact, not a discretisation error). (4) `WDFParallelT`/pot legs at
> a literal 0 Ω → NaN; floor parallel-adaptor pot legs at 0.5 Ω. (5) `NodalCircuit::addOpAmp` does
> NOT support `kInput` as the (+) node (silently drops the input term → floating output); route

- **Source material**: three Japanese-language reverse-engineering blog posts by kanengomibako
  (unofficial, non-commercial-use-only schematics) — see `circuit.md` header for URLs. All three
  schematics + per-control frequency-response sim reference images are saved under `schematics/
  {v1-early,v1-late,v2}/`, plus 2×-upscaled quadrant crops under `schematics/crops/` (and FR-graph
  reading copies under `schematics/crops/fr/`) for anything `circuit.md` doesn't already capture.
  The FR graphs are quantitatively transcribed into `docs/reference-fr-targets.md`.
- **2nd-pass verification done** (Opus): re-traced the schematics and re-read every FR graph. Two
  first-draft errors fixed in `circuit.md` — (1) LEVEL is a **post-BLEND master level**, not a
  dry-path level (corrected signal order: PRESENCE→DRIVE→…→BLEND→LEVEL→[V2 MID]→BASS→TREBLE→out);
  (2) the mid "notch" is actually **two** features — a deep ~800 Hz character notch (input twin-T,
  all revisions) vs a gentle ~430 Hz bridged-T mid-cut (V1e/V1l only, removed on V2). Everything
  else in the first-pass transcription verified correct.
- **Headline finding**: the three revisions differ far more than component values — V1 Early has
  **no clipping diodes at all** in the drive stage (op-amp rail saturation only); V1 Late and V2
  both use a small zener-clipping sub-module (different zener part number each: `DZ23C3V3` vs
  `BZB984-C3V3`, same 3.3 V back-to-back topology) needing bespoke WDF treatment (reverse zener
  breakdown isn't what `chowdsp_wdf`'s `DiodePairT`/`DiodeT` model) — **now built (Phase 4,
  `ZenerPairT.h`); see the Phase-4 carry-forward below.** Tone stack topology also changes: V1 Early is
  Baxandall shelving, V1 Late/V2 are peaking, and V2 adds a whole new MID control (post-blend,
  switchable center freq) plus a BASS-frequency-shift switch neither V1 revision has.
- **3rd-pass verification (Fable) resolved every open schematic item** — see `circuit.md`
  Validation notes: the `IC3A` `?` is an IC part-number caveat (not wiring; DRIVE gain
  1+330k/3.3k = +40.1 dB matches the FR sim exactly, cross-validating the transcription); V2
  MID/MID-SHIFT and BASS-SHIFT are Baxandall peaking stages with DPDT cap-toggling wiper legs
  (SW4A half unused); both output switches short a 22k feedback R → closed = unity = the throw we
  model (open = +10.1 dB = LINE/"+10dB", matching panel labels numerically). Remaining genuinely
  open work: the zener WDF element (planned research spike) and capture-anchored calibration.
- **4th pass (Fable): node-level netlists for every stage, all three revisions, now in
  `.claude/rules/netlists.md`** — DSP tasks read their stage's netlist, never a schematic image.
  Headline finds: V1L/V2 **DRIVE pot is shared between two coupled inverting module stages**
  (wiper = stage-A output; validated numerically: +12.9/+48.6 dB vs FR §4's +12.5/+48);
  V1L/V2 presence = pot-in-feedback (different cell from V1e's rheostat-leg); V1L LEVEL =
  single inverting stage with 100k-loaded wiper (taper interacts); dry tap = input-buffer
  OUTPUT on all three; recovery = unity Sallen-Key LPF pairs. circuit.md's affected Function
  cells are annotated; **netlists.md wins on conflict**. Residual `[◐]` items each carry a
  named FR self-validation gate (e.g. V1L C10/R14 wet-HP read → check §1 LF before trusting).
- **Locked decisions** (do not re-litigate; full table in `docs/build-plan.md`): one plugin with an
  automatable `revision` choice param + per-revision UI face; V1 Early built first; **three DSP
  graph classes** sharing primitives; identity = Leigh Pierce / `LPrc` / `NALR` /
  `com.leighpierce.noamplowriderdi` (reuse `LPrc` on future pedals).
- **DSP method (decided Phase 1, user chose "most accurate").** Passive bridge/twin-T stages use
  chowdsp R-type adaptors with a scattering matrix computed **numerically** from topology + live port
  impedances (`src/dsp/RtypeNumeric.h`, `S = 2·Aᵀ(A·Gd·Aᵀ)⁻¹·A·Gd − I`, wave conv `v=(a+b)/2,
  i=(a−b)/2R` verified vs chowdsp) — no hand-transcribed matrices. Non-inverting op-amp *gain* stages
  use the ideal-op-amp decomposition (`src/dsp/OpAmpStage.h`). **Op-amp-embedded LINEAR stages where
  the output feeds back into its own input network** (active Sallen-Key, inverting tone/gain — 1.3
  onward) use a bilinear-companion **MNA engine** (`src/dsp/NodalCircuit.h`, ideal op-amps as
  nullors): identical accuracy to WDF for linear circuits, far lower silent-error surface than a
  hand-rolled nullor scattering matrix. WDF wave-domain stays reserved for the Phase-4 nonlinear
  zener (its real edge). Validate every stage vs an independent frequency-domain reference — for
  bilinear engines, compare at the **warp-compensated** frequency `fa=(fs/π)tan(πf/fs)` to isolate
  correctness from top-octave warp — **and** the FR §-targets. NodalCircuit gotcha (cost real time):
  an input-coupled cap injects `+Gc·vin` into the far node (same sign as a resistor); a grounded-cap
  RC self-check will NOT catch this sign — the bridged-T (input-coupled cap) did.
- **Two plan-gate expectations were idealized; the faithful models (confirmed vs complex MNA to
  <0.01 dB) reveal the real behaviour — trust the model, not the naive gate:** (1) BLEND off-side
  isolation is NOT `<-80 dB` — it's cap-impedance-limited (C1 72 Ω / C12 3.4k at 1 kHz vs the 100k
  pot), so ~−22..−56 dB, asymmetric, frequency-dependent (a real blend pot leaks the off-side; more
  faithful than an ideal crossfade). (2) The output buffer (E8) is NOT unity/~6 Hz — it has a fixed
  **−0.85 dB insertion loss** (R33 1k / R29 10k divider; **feed this into output-makeup calibration
  Phase 3/10**) and a **~13 Hz** DC-block corner (cascade of two 2.2 µF sections, higher than the
  netlist's rough "~6 Hz"); flat within 0.25 dB only above ~60–80 Hz.
- **§3 `fr_presence_drive` is the op-amp gain block ALONE, no twin-T notch** — validate PRESENCE/DRIVE
  gain (1+Zf/Zg) against §3 (min +12.2 / mid +16.7 / max +34.2 dB @ 4.8 kHz, peak migrates 864→4829
  Hz ✓), the notch against §1. **RESOLVED: the twin-T (~−24 dB stage-level) reaches §1's −36.3 dB @
  ~715 Hz once the recovery superposes (full wet path, 1.3) — the twin-T was correct; no revisit
  needed.** §1's ~−9 dB LF edge still needs the downstream BLEND (C12) + tone (C25) coupling HPs (1.4/1.5).
- **Phase 2 (V1E nonlinearity) findings.** (1) Rail clip = **±4.2 V** about VCOM (matches the locked
  power constant; the build-plan §2.1 "±4.5 V" text is STALE — forgets D5). Hard clamp (rail-to-rail
  TLC226x), 1st-order ADAA, exact piecewise antiderivative — `RailClip.h`. (2) **Recovery DC gain =
  0.6875** (IC3C R17/R12 = 22/32 input attenuator, the −3.3 dB): the DRIVE→recovery region OUTPUT =
  (clip-node volts)×0.6875, so at full drive it saturates at ≈±4.2·0.6875 = ±2.89 V, NOT ±4.2 —
  **feed this recovery attenuation into Phase-3/10 output-makeup calibration**. (3) Gate results: 4×
  OS aliasing is below the −94 dB measurement floor (1× genuine −79 dB alias driven to the floor by
  OS); ADAA cuts 1× aliasing by ~22 dB. (4) **Prewarp DEFERRED to Phase 9**: on V1E the dominant HF
  (cab-sim) caps live in the oversampled DRIVE→recovery region so they're correctly NOT prewarped;
  every remaining base-rate HF corner is knob-swept (presence peak, tone-pot shelves — dsp.md forbids
  prewarping swept corners) EXCEPT the one fixed tone-stack feedback corner **C29 ~7.2 kHz** (sub-dB)
  — record it as the single deferred prewarp target, to be tuned with the low-OS shelf against
  `OSFidelity` (don't perturb the gated 1.5 stage blind now).
- **Phase 3 (integration) facts.** (1) **⚠ DO NOT quote calibration constants from this file — read
  `src/dsp/Calibration.h`.** It is the single source of truth and this section was stale for a week
  (it claimed kInputRef=0.87 and kOutputMakeup=1.0 long after both had moved, which is exactly how
  L-008's stack got built on a number nobody re-checked). As of 2026-07-17 the actual values are
  **kInputRef[3] = { 7.0, 1.3, 1.3 }** (V1E/V1L/V2 — PER-REVISION as of the 2026-07-18 stack unwind;
  V1E=7.0 + kDriveEndR=0 + saturator OFF, see Gap I) and **kOutputMakeup[3] = { 1.084, 1.121, 0.618 }** (V1E/V1L/V2, T-002-anchored to dry-path unity at
  blend=0 / level=0.5 — NOT capture-level-fitted). `kDryGain` is **DELETED** — never reintroduce it
  (ISS-008). (2) **LEVEL is modelled INSIDE the DSP** (the pedal's LEVEL pot, in V1EarlyBlendLevelStage),
  so there is NO separate `volumeGain` scalar in the processor — output gain = `kOutputMakeup ·
  dbToGain(outTrim) / kInputRef` only (`outputGainFor()`). Don't go looking for a volume taper to
  fit; LEVEL's law is the circuit. (3) Measured dry-path (blend=0) gain at LEVEL noon = **−0.70 dB**
  (integration test) — near-unity, consistent with the −0.85 dB output-buffer loss; confirms the
  dry-tap→BLEND→LEVEL→tone→output wiring and that kInputRef cancels in the linear path. (4) Processor
  gotcha resolved: per-sample SmoothedValue advanced per-channel ramps 2× too fast in stereo and
  desyncs L/R — precompute the input-trim/output-gain/bypass ramps ONCE per block into shared arrays,
  index both channels into them.
- **Phase 4 (zener clip) — RESOLVED the one open WDF research item.** `ZenerPairT.h`:
  antiparallel-pair is `I=2·Is·sinh(V/Vt)` → reuse Werner eqn-18 (DiodePairT `Good`-form) with
  `(Is,Vt)` reparameterised from the zener knee, honouring `nalr::AccurateOmega` (NOT omega4). Cj =
  `CapacitorT` in parallel (pair caps in series → ~half a device's Cd → "~100 pF class"; sets the §4
  DRIVE HF rolloff). `ZenerFeedbackClipper` (`Ig∥Rf∥Cj∥zener`, `vOut=−V_fb`) is the reusable stage
  Phase 5's V1L/V2 drive module drops in (same class both revs; differ only in Rf/Cj/coupling +
  zener knee). **Params (fit, refine in Phase 10): `Vz 3.3, Vf 0.65, Vzt 0.20, Iref 5 mA` → Vth≈3.95.**
  **Softness TRAP that cost real time: do NOT set `Vzt` from the datasheet `r_dif` (~0.5 V) — that
  single-exp is so leaky it kills the small-signal linear gain and clamps soft at ~2.4 V; use the
  sharper ~0.20 V (clean linear region, holds near the 3.3 V rating).** Not yet OS/ADAA'd (Phase 6).
- **The build plan lives in `docs/build-plan.md`** — per-task model (Opus 4.8 vs Sonnet 5) + effort
  assignments, exact read-lists per task (token discipline), and numeric validation gates keyed to
  `docs/reference-fr-targets.md` §§. UI visuals are validated by the user (send PNGs, never
  self-review screenshots); captures arrive later and only Phase 10 depends on them.
- **UI asset/layout groundwork built ahead of schedule (2026-07-12, out of phase order — DSP was
  mid-Phase-6 at the time)**, at the user's request, so the pedal face is ready once Phase 7's
  revision-switching lands. Full detail in `docs/ui-noamp-assets.md`; headline: `PedalLookAndFeel`/
  `LEDIndicator`/`ThreePositionSwitch` all gained an *optional* bitmap-override path (vector drawing
  stays the default/fallback — `ui.md`), fed by a new `src/ui/PedalAssets.{h,cpp}` + `NoAmpAssets`
  CMake binary-data target embedding the user's photographic knob/switch/LED/footswitch sprites,
  three per-revision faceplate textures, and the Anton display font (OFL). Wordmark reskinned to
  "NoAmp"/"LOW RIDER DI" (the reference layout images are Tech21's actual faceplate — replicate the
  physical layout only, not their wordmark). `tests/UIRenderProbe.cpp` headlessly renders all 3
  revisions × 3 UI scales to PNG for review. **All knob/control positions in `PluginEditor`'s
  `layoutV1`/`layoutV2` are first-pass eyeballed estimates** — expect a tuning pass once the user
  reviews renders (normal per `build-plan.md`'s Phase 8 iterate loop, not a follow-up bug).
